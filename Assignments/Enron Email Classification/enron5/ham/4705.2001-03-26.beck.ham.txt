jafry ,
here is the actual presentation requirements as per the rfp . we can deviate
from the form , but must address their stated requirements . i think we
should structure the enron portion as follows :
i . enw overview
ii . products and services
iii . engagement approach
let me know what you think . we need to pull this together today .
i ' ve also attached the material steve sent me previously .
thanks ,
greg
