Subject: speeding up your hiring process
hiring managers ,
here are a few tips that will immediately improve the time it takes to make a
offer to your candidates .
all applicants must fill out and sign an application and a fair credit
reporting act form ( included with the application ) prior to being
interviewed . you may either have the applicant fill out a form before you
interview them or you can send the applicant to the 36 th floor to fill out
the forms before you interview them .
notify hector mcloughlin or frank dejesus if you are interviewing an external
candidate that is a former enron employee . all previous enron employees
will be reviewed by hr and sally beck prior to being invited to interview .
we hope that this process will eliminate re - hiring poor performers .
if you want to make an offer of employment to a candidate for a management
position , please include sally beck in the process for input . as a final
step of the selection process , sally would like to meet with the candidate if
time allows or to phone interview the candidate as an alternative . sally ' s
involvement should occur after you have identified the candidate as a
potential management new hire .
thanks for your help with this process .
