dear karen ,
thank you again for including me in your group of finalists for the enron scholarship . enron ' s commitment to community service and education is most admirable , i and felt honored to be selected ( particularly considering the other people chosen ) . i even enjoyed the interview experience , mostly because of the neat interviewers .
i also appreciate the prompt replies to all correspondence , as well as the follow - up call this evening ( even if the news was not quite what i wanted to hear ) . it ' s great to see people " doing it right " . if you need any assistance with future events at ut , please don ' t hesitate to call .
sincerely ,
david silldorff
