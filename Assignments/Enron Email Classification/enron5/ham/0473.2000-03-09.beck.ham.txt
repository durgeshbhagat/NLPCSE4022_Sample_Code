delighted to have todd over for a month .

i guess he should plan to fly over next weekend to be here for the monday -
bright and early . the timing is crucial .
he would work jointly with neil tarling ( director ) on the project - basically
- to seperate the continental power book into 4 / 5 regional books - complete
with individual portfolio ' s , fully documented inter - book trades , currency
functionality and control gates . he will be working with traders , comm supp &

i suggest todd touches base with james - project ' lead ' - to get some
backgroung information about the market .
