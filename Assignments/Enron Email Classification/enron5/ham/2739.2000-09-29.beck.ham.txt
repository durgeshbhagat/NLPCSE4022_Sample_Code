this memo apparently was already out on e : mail when we were meeting in my
office regarding confirmations . the language regarding jeff ' s role on
financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo . it wasn ' t
clear to me when we met whether scott and leslie had talked while looking at
a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on e : mail . since you said
that you had not seen this memo , please follow up with scott , leslie and jeff
to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and
settlements so that can be communicated within the organization . there
should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms
and settlements . this memo as sent will create that confusion . thanks .
