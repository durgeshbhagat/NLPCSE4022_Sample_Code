gbn steering committee meeting , 09 april 2000
may 17 th speaker - no sponsor . we decided against having a cover charge and to
use gbn funds . we felt a cover might reduce attendance and wanted to keep the
speaker series free for attendees . a $ 10 cover wouldn ' t cover all of the
expenses anyway and we felt it would create a bad impression . deed vest of
rockwell international has confirmed availability for the date . carolyn is
handling the set up .
