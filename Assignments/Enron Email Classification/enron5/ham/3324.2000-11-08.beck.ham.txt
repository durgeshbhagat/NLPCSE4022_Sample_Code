first of all . . . . i hope you are feeling well . . . with all of the emails going
back and forth i haven ' t taken the time to say so . . .
i just spoke with lou santorie with sempra . he said that they are very
interested in confirm corp and would be looking for a company to partner
with . he said that basically " if enron would decide to use this application "
that the industry would have to get on board . . . basically sounds like he feels
that we would set the stage for what is used in the industry as far a
clearing applications .
we had a brainstorming meeting with the commodity logic team at
lunch . . . . their concepts are good for phase i but we would get the biggest
bang from their later phase concept where they intend to do the automatching
of deal info . between us and the counterparty . . . . . .
