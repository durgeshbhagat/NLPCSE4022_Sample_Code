Subject: helsinki
here is the abridged draft of the document for the presentation to joe sutton .
the ' expected loss ' calculation in the previous version was intended to show
the outcome if we assume some recovery of amounts owing from vneshtopprom ,
but until we re - engage in the negotiation we can only speculate as to what
this may be . hence , we have restricted the analysis to the maximum exposure .
please e - mail kevin sweeney and me with any comments / amendments .
