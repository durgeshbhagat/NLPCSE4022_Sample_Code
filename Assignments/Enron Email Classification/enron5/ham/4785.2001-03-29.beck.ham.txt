Subject: unify financials update and go - forward cut - over calendar
a quick update on a major milestone for the unify effort , the critical success factors and the plan for the gas and power deliveries .
first , the good news - - - we rolled out the new unify financials system on monday . the rollout so far is very nearly a flawless success . only 2 small bugs have been identified and both were fixed within 1 day . the users in houston and london have commented that the system is noticeably faster . this system was delivered 4 weeks ahead of the original schedule that we published in early january . for a project of this size and complexity , this is great news and bodes well for the next 2 major milestones .
we ' re not out of the woods yet . our biggest and most risky rollouts are a few weeks away - power and gas .
even so , as we look ahead , we are very optimistic . based on our empirical load testing , we believe that we can now deliver incremental performance increases and long - term scaleability far beyond what the legacy architecture would support . reliability and stability should continue to increase beyond the recently improved performance we ' ve gotten from the new legacy hardware .
this milestone success is due to the following critical factors :
? strong executive it sponsorship and participation ( special thanks to philippe bibi , beth perlman , jenny rub , bob mcauliffe , richard burchfield )
? strong executive user sponsorship and user participation ( special thanks to sally beck , bob hall , leslie reeves , sheila glover , cindy horn , peggy hedstrom and laura scott )
? adoption of a risk - managed delivery methodology based on detailed planning and a phased delivery approach
? a talented enron delivery team with great technical skills and the dedication to work nearly every weekend for the last 2 months ( and the next 2 )
? exemplary partnering between the infrastructure , application , dba and user teams
? uncompromising commitments to team success from the vendors ( special thanks to microsoft , accenture , compaq , avenade )
? focused project management ( special thanks to ramesh rao , dale potter , mike croucher and jim ogg ) .
the attachment below provides a calendar of activities for everything that ' s happening between now and mid - may . power will go live on april 23 and gas will go live on may 21 . the user bid - week simulation and performance tests for gas begin next week . as the calendar below shows , the team is fully occupied for the next 2 months .
