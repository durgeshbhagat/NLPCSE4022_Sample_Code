Subject: bridge monitoring
we encountered a problem with the sitara bridge this morning and it has
uncovered the importance of risk ' s involvement in watching this - especially
during the morning hours . the sitara bridge failed at 10 : 35 a . m . and we came
very close to missing our nom deadlines on several next day deals . we
( product control ) do have a safeguard in place ( our it department is beeped
if a deal stays in intermediate status for over 5 minutes ) , but we did not
receive timely notification of this issue - it was at least 15 minutes after
the problem started . we have fixed that going forward - jennifer denny and
torrey moorer will be beeped in addition to it .
we will continue to make every effort to watch the bridge ; however , the risk
groups ( or some designated individual ( s ) ) must be watching this as well to
ensure that any deals that fail are entered into the downstream systems on a
timely basis , and primarily to alert us of any problems asap . if anyone in
your respective groups need additional training or assistance , please call
jennifer denny at x 35824 or torrey moorer at x 36218 .
i have attached a file with the 35 transactions that were in intermediate
status ( just fyi )
please call me if you have any questions .
