valarie ,
thanks again for the emails you sent to us on 9 / 1 / 00 and 9 / 4 / 00 regarding the
killed deals for the city of vernon . the reports you provided were exactly
what we needed in order to explain the large cash flow change received from
the west book . please continue to send these types of reports in the
future .
