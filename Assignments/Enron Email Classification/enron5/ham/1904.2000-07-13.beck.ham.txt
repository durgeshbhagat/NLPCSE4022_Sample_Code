Subject: dear sally ,
since we may not be able to have our bi - weekly meeting , i thought i ' d let you
know what ' s going on :
dpr
i ' m working with london to determine how to report the mg dpr to us . nothing
has been decided yet as we are waiting on the risk management policies & risk
limits from our guys in london .
as you know , plenty of v @ r questions have been coming our way , and are
somewhat difficult for mike ' s team to answer . i talked with eugenio and he
is in the process of putting together some v @ r analytics / graphs mike ' s guys
can easily create to answer simpler v @ r questions .
burton , a book analyst in brent ' s group is coming back to mike ' s dpr group to
support gary stadler and work on the benchmark reports and curve
validations . jenifer bagwell has taken burton ' s place in brent ' s group .
a while back , eugenio created a database to capture information and allows
book & commodity analysis . he has been showing this to business unit
controllers & the rac group , but has not distributed it yet , due to security
issues . currently , the database does not restrict different users to
different commodities ( power people can see gas and vice versa ) . it will
slow down the database considerably if these restrictions are put in , but it
may be necessary . i think the business controllers would not share the
information with commercial , but i ' m not sure about the analysts in the rac
group . i ' d like to get your opinion on this .
doorstep
i ' ve updated the presentation to include places and planned visits for
offices previously not visited and second offices visits for the next year
donna , ted , richard l . and i have a meeting scheduled to go over the follow
up of the first visits - i ' ll update you after the meeting .
hope you had a good vacation !
regards
