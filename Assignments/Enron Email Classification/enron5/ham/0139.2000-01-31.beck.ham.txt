fernley ,
generally , this seems to be fine . i think that steve and i would like to
clarify the credit limit review issue . please see him for some semantical
changes to that one line .
regarding the expected / maximum exposure calculation , i believe that this is
incredibly misleading and if not changed would be inclined to forward my own
interpretation . we lost $ 18 mm ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! - not $ 5 mm . i think
that we should make a distinction between what has already been realized as
opposed to what writedowns need to be taken , but it all better add up to
$ 18 mm . regarding the additional exposures , my impression is that our true
expectation for counterparty claims is close to zero while we do expect to
terminate one or more employees which would incur severance cost .

rick ,
the attached report is an updated version of the document we discussed on
friday of last week . some of the numbers in the exposure analysis are still
draft and i expect firm numbers in the next few hours .
my aim would be to streamline this report for the presentation to joe sutton ,
but i would welcome your steer on how you plan to conduct the meeting and
whether or not this format is appropriate .
regards
fernley
