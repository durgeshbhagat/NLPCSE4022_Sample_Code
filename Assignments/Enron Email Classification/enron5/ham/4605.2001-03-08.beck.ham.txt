Subject: anniversary party
hello , sistas -
just visited with the coordinator of josephine ' s house . here ' s some
additional info . - and we have a few questions to answer :
1 ) i have reserved the place on my credit card - there will be no actual
charge until the day of the event .
2 ) for a party of our size , they will offer a choice of soup or salad , 3
entrees and 2 desserts . if we have a special request , we can let her know ;
otherwise the choices will simply be from whatever the jeffery ' s chef has
cookin ' that night .
3 ) we need to choose either a soup or a salad for our group . preferences ?
4 ) at some point , we will need to decide if we want to do hors deuvres in
addition to the three course meal . she suggested oysters ( for which they
are famous ) and then some other , non - seafood appetizer . these would be
served as guests arrive .
5 ) she is faxing me a wine list - and would like to have our selection in
advance of the event . also , she asked if we wanted beer and an open bar in
addition to wine . i told her i ' d check with you - but that we wouldn ' t be
a heavy drinking crowd and that wine would probably be fine . i thought we
might also want to do champagne - either with the appetizers or sometime
during the meal ( maybe dessert ? ) in case we want to give a toast to the
happy couple .
thoughts , everyone ? - the youngest and fattest
