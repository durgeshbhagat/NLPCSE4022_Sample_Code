Subject: re : dinner next week
spoke to mo yesterday - - sounds like we are on for wed night - - babysitter is
all arranged
so - - should i make a reservation
what sounds good ? oxo tower was one that brent was going to when he visited
last time ( can ' t take a baby there so we opted for something more casual )
they have all types of european / continental type food - - and a georgeous
rooftop view of the city
another favorite of mo , frank and i is the gaucho grill which is sort of a
european version of churrasco ' s - - they serve argentinian steaks that are
just awesome with some good red wine - - but if you don ' t like steaks you are
out of luck here . this one is close to the le meridian where you usually
stay - - no view , but interesting decor inside the restraunt
any others you have heard of that would like to try out ?
let me know and janine will make the reservation
