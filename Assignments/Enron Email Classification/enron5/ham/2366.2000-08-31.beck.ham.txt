sheila ,
we have been having issues with the commodity cash flows since last friday ,
aug 25 . this is a listing of what ' s been going on .
time pdh
date commodity book given to trader summary of discussion
8 / 25 / 00 enpower - west 7 : 05 original west cash flows did not look
right . valerie left voice mail
late thursday night stating not to treat the $ 18 m gain as
final . she indicated that lavorato was going to review the
cash flows this morning and she will let us know the final
number at that time . these cashflows created a $ 19 , 000
pvol affect .
7 : 45 re - ran w / old west cf after consulting with pushkar , we
replaced the new west cash flows with prior days so hedging
could begin .
10 : 15 final spoke with monica lande at 9 : 30 am and she stated that
the original cash flows received were real . we then had to
bring the original cash flows back and re - do the pdh
reports .
8 / 28 / 00 refer to email sent by sheila on this day .
8 / 29 / 00 uk - nap - lt - prc 7 : 35 cash flows received from the uk book looked
really weird .
the $ 38 m cash flow curve change created a 15 , 000 pvol
affect . we contacted guy freshwater regarding . he
indicated that per mark fondren , the book was officialized
monday , on friday since monday was a holiday for their
office . we backed out the new cash flow , and then substituted
the old ones .
8 / 30 / 00 uk - nap - lt - prc 7 : 30 original the same thing happened as 8 / 29 / 00 .
the book was not officialized
7 : 45 final on 8 / 29 , therefore we received the same incorrect cash
flows . we again
substituted these cash flows with those received on 8 / 25 / 00 . i
talked with
mark fondren and he indicated that the book has now been
officialized .
( in the past we have not had issues with the uk commodity books in
the
erms system . )
8 / 31 / 00 enpower - west 7 : 20 original cash flows received for west created
a 14 , 000 pvol affect . we contacted
8 : 00 final monica lande and she informed us that there was a $ 14 m
loss in their book ,
but $ 6 m was not real . we asked for a cash flow strip for the
incorrect flows , but she was not able to provide it . therefore , we
used the previous day ' s cash
flows . after the 7 : 20 pdh report , the system started running slow ,
therefore
it took even longer to produce a revised report .
