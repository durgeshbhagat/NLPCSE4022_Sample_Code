bob is a good , solid player . he won ' t change the world , but he is diligent
about getting a prescribed job done . i personally like bob a lot , and am
very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him . his
wife has ms in its most severe stages . he was a manager previously , and we
jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order
to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work . he needs to be able
to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a
caregiver who is with his wife while he works . i made a personnal commitment
to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and
predictable end to his work day , and as long as he is in my group i will
personally make sure that works for him . i would hope for him that if he
ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same .
danny contacted me about bob , more from the standpoint of asking me what
impact it would have on gas if he moved . i suggested that brent would be
better able to address that . i did tell danny that the onslaught of eol
transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations , and i am sure that
they are not long on people . i assume that danny is following up with
brent . - - sally
