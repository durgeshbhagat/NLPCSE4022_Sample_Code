wanda -
fyi , joe hirl , the trader in charge of setting up the tokyo trading office ,
will be in houston next week , and it would probably be a good idea if he
could interview mark frank , or whatever candidate we recommend for the
controller position . our controller for the sydney office will be up the
following week and he should meet with her as well , as that will enable him
to get first hand knowledge of the remote trading office establishment issues
we ' ve addressed in australia .
sally - did you decide on the one candidate you thought of when we met last ?
we might want to arrange a meeting with him and joe also .
thanks ,
cassandra .
