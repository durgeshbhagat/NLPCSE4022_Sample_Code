Subject: timing of submitting information to risk controls
over the past few weeks , we have not been receiving information from the risk
management groups on a timely basis . this memo serves to convey our
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group .
our reporting is as follows ( houston time ) :
7 : 45 - posting of preliminary dpr to website ( needed to be done prior to rac
8 am meeting )
7 : 45 - 2 : 00 - preparation of the violation / notification memos
2 : 00 - finalization of the dpr & memos
in order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to
meet the following deadlines ( houston time ) :
before leaving to go home ( houston ) : officialization of books ( to ensure
information is captured in var engine and credit agg )
4 : 00 ( london ) : officialization and sending of feeds to it
7 : 20 ( all ) : export of preliminary information
7 : 20 - 3 : 00 : support on explanations of violations / notification memos
11 : 00 ( london only ) : export of final information ( needed at that time for
merchant asset group )
12 : 00 ( houston only ) : export of final information
everyday at least one group misses the deadline , which is unacceptable .
please ensure deadlines are met going forward . remember , the dpr cannot go
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the
whole process .
thank you ,
