hector : the key employees that jeff has identified are senior specialists ,
with the exception of will kelly . if you remember , these are the risk
employees that i was concerned about when steve jackson tendered his letter
of resignation . steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor , and
it is not inconceivable that he might approach some enron employees to join
him and help ensure his success with his new employer . we don ' t want this to
happen . waiting until the end of november to implement an effective
retention plan does not make sense . please call me tomorrow and let ' s talk
about how we can jump start this . thanks . - - sally

jeff ,
i spoke with todd burke regarding a retention strategy for the managers we
talked about . he told me that he would make a recommendation after he
completes the pay practices survery by mid - november in order to accurately
compensate them . he is concerned that we may present an inaccurate plan for
retention without market data .
if this is a very urgent issue for you please let us know . if you suspect
that the managers are being made offers then please let us know .
