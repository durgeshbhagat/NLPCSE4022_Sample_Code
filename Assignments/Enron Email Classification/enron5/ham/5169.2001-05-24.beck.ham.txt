Subject: transfers from ees
attached is the latest version of the cost center assignments for the transfers out of ees . these transfers will be effective july 1 , 2001 and i need to get this to hr by friday , june 1 , 2001 to give them time to get everything effected .
i think i have incorporated all your comments , but please review one more time and make sure we have not included anyone we shouldn ' t have or excluded anyone . you ' ll note that at this point we are not forming east and west risk management cost centers . don and rogers have decided for cost management purposes to leave it consolidated at this point .
once you have signed off on your groupings , rachel massey in corporate planning will be working with each of you to forecast your q 3 and q 4 cost center expense plans .
please let me know asap of any changes and don ' t hesitate to call with questions .
thanks
wade
