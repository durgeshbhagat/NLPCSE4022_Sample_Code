sally ,
this includes most of the suggestions andy made ( all the word / format related ones , at least ) . the only one i have not made relates to our discussion about adding a slide that outlines the history behind the operations pricing desk and the various factors considered in building it . please let me know if you ' re busy and want me to glean the information from the slides you have archived .
lets talk about it in more detail tomorrow . if you need me at anytime , please feel free to contact me on my cell phone at 281 . 704 . 1060
regards ,
rahil
