objective
enron is sizing up the opportunity to offer internal back office processing
services to external clients . objective of this meeting was to understand the
spreadsheet meant to estimate the potential p & l for this offering .
overview
looked at spreadsheet for validation :
? need to better determine the actual market for this service .
? need to better understand the current revenue and expense projections and
assumptions , expanding on them to include customers not currently with enron .
ongoing :
defining the size of the market :
? there may be three  + levels  , of markets for these services - one for energy
risk mgt . ops ( attack first ) , a larger market if we include global market
offerings , and yet a larger market if we think of our offering as transaction
processing , ala adp .
? there are a number of ways to derive the potential market size . the
current spreadsheet identifies existing customers . some may be seeking our
services based on their current and projected deal volumes .
? fred will continue to analyze the market size ( s ) , adding customers outside
of current eol spectrum .
? fred will analyze the offerings and pricing structures used by competitors .
? sheri will get with internal data owners to ( in ) validate current
spreadsheet numbers and identify customers with high year - over - year increases
in eol transaction volume .
expenses
? james will take a harder look at the expenses . we wonder if number of
transactions is the best method to use . what is the real cost driver ? where
are the  + breaking points  , , or transaction levels where we must invest further
to offer services to additional customers ?
strategy
? beth apollo will schedule a meeting with beth perlman , jenny rub , rahil , et
al to discuss ongoing big picture .
? beth will also schedule a meeting with mark taylor , to include rahil and
dale . they will discuss points on the service level agreement that we will
use with our external customers .
