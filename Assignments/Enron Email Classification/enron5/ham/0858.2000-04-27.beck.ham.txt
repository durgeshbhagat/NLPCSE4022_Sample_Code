Subject: dpr signoff
the risk management policy requires signoff on the dpr by individuals
designated by the coo and cro of enron corp . currently , greg is the sole
authorized signer . given that he is moving into cyberspace it has been
proposed that we split the world in half with john l taking the western
hemisphere and john s taking the rest of the world . i am currently drafting
a memo for jeff and rick ' s signature to that effect , in the meantime , i
would expect that greg remain the official signer . i will forward that draft
memo to you for commentary under separate cover . once we have agreed on who
as responsibility for what , we will ask that the johns reply to an e - mail
request for approval . eventually , we will create an automatic approval via
the executive reports viewer . before finalizing process , there are some
issues that ought to be clarified , such as , who will signoff for the merchant
portfolios that are not part of either johns direct responsibility ( southern
cone , calme ) , broadband , the capital portfolio . for pure process reasons , we
would like to keep the number of signers ot a minimum . it is difficult
enough to get greg to sign off in a timely manner , it would be too cumbersome
for mike moscoso or chris abel to chase down someone from every business unit
every day for approvals .
please let me know if you have any suggestions or changes to this proposal .
