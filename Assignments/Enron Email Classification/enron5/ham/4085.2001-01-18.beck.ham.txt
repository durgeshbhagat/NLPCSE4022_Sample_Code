sally - while you are in london , do you want to share information with mike

attend .

subject : notes on ase studio
hello mary -
here is a rough strating point of the ase studio planning document . i have
included the objectives we discussed initially - we will continue to refine
them as we move forward .
also , i inserted the notes i made during the offsite on friday . my notes
were primarily focused on information that the participants were wanting or
that i thought might be useful . also , i jotted down quite a few questions
that came up during the session . some of them were addressed on friday and
others were not . we do not necessarily need to address all of these at the
ase - and i would suspect there are others that should be addressed but are
not listed here . i ' m sending this information in advance for your review and
thought .
if you have any questions or would like to discuss , please let me know .
