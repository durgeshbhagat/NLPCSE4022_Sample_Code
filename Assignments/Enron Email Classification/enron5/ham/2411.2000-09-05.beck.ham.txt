sorry if there was any confusion in my email - it was not actually prompted
by your questions about enlighten , which haven ' t caused ripples and in any
case are appropriate questions to ask .
i ' m really trying to get commitment from business sponsors ( principally mike
on this side ) on both sides of the pond to agree a common timetable for
functionality . if we don ' t get this , it may be difficult for us to maintain
a common database across houston and london , and it will end up acting as a
broker between different business areas when establishing priorities . i
doubt any of us want that .
cheers
john

for global markets , we were not scheduled to get anything by the end of the
year from enlighten , envoice or dtl . but in order to establish what could
potentially be delivered by july 2001 , we were inquiring as to the data
elements that were going to be stored as well as the functionality . it would
be hard to make committments to use an application , without really knowing
what it does . clarification was what we were trying to get and will require ,
to do a true gap analysis so we can quantify the extent that these
applications fit or do not fit our business .
i received a functional spec for envoice today and would like to get one for
dtl and enlighten to get a better understanding of the scope of these and
possible enhancements that could be added on later .
i am sorry if my queries caused some " ripples " . i still would like some
tangible information to start looking at regarding these applications .
please let me know what information you can supply us . thanks cindy

dear all
there is currently some debate as to what is going to be delivered by
enlighten . some clarification and a question :
clarification :
enlighten ( certainly in london ) is actually a data hub , rather than an
application . in itself , it will not add business value . however , the tools
which sit on top of this system will add business value . these tools are
currently dtl , envoice , zebra . however , i think we all anticipate more
requirements being developed as this central data store becomes richer .
question ( for business sponsors ) :
we are trying hard to coordinate us and uk efforts . however , this will be
extremely difficult if our respective business timelines are not the same .
say - for example - mike wants enlighten to deliver volumetric reporting by
then end of 2000 but cindy instead wants a full dpr in the same timeline .
our data architects are going to struggle to coordinate and prioritise their
work if we are working for two separate sets of masters . so :
if we are really to reap the rewards of a uk / us implementation , a common
timetable is extremely important . who are our primary uk and us business
sponsors and can we ask them to agree a mutual timeline ? i suspect if we
are to try and make this a joint development , nothing will make delivery
harder than having separate and sometimes mutually exclusive sets of
requirements from our user communities .
comments / answers please . . .
cheers
