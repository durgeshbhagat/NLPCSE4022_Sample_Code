Subject: physical - financial tagg
we have switched all the ena financial gas deals that should be marked as
physical . again , we flipped these deals through a physical book so that the
options trader could see his positions . there appear to be deals still out
there for global markets , south america , and ecc .
debbie - some of these deals actually should still be financial .
leslie - if you will get in touch with canada , i will talk to global markets
and south america .
thanks
