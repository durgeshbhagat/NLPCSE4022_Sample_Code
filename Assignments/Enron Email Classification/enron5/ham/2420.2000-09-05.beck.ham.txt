infinity showed a $ 19 mm notional curve shift change in the ei - gns - gas - prc
commodity book for 9 / 1 / 00 . this change caused a ( 10 , 200 ) pvol affect on the
trader ' s sensitivity report . after talking with susan in ei , it was brought
to our attention that the bolivian curve was loaded incorrectly on friday ,
due to a change in ei ' s curve upload process . this change resulted in the
bolivian curve loading throughout 2012 , when it actually goes out to 2019 .
the incomplete curve caused infinity to get bad cash flows .
as a result , we had to re - do pdh reports this morning . final reports were
given to traders at 9 : 00 am .
