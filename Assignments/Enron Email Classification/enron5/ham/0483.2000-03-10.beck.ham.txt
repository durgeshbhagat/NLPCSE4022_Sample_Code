Subject: dear friends and family ,
i wanted to pass along the unfortunate news that i miscarried earlier today
and will have the procedure most likely monday to remove the tissue . i am
handling the news well , but ask that you allow me until tuesday or wednesday
to deal with the situation . of course , i am available , as always , to handle
any urgent issues .
so , for today , i have ordered myself a huge arrangement from my favorite
florist , will have a glass of wine with dinner and spend time with both my
husband and my best friend sophie . it should be a good day , after all .
thanks for understanding .
sue
