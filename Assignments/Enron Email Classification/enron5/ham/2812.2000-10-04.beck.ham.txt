inja ,
per the conference call today i am confident that we can add value to the
commodity logic project . i base this on the success of enron online and
valtech ' s role of supporting that effort . currently , we have the architect
( david jayakaran ) that designed the presentation framework for eol available
as part of the team . i mention this because of the obvious synergy between
the eol framework and commodity logic . as discussed david will meet with you
on wednesday . the action items i owe you are the enron negotiated rate
structure and profiles for consultants that could start immediately . the
daily rates are senior consultants at $ 2 , 000 and consultants at $ 1 , 750 . the
profiles are attached for your review . please contact me if you have any
questions .
regards ,
martin
