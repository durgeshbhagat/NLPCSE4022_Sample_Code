kathryn has done a good job of keeping me in the loop on this . in addition , kim has consistently provided useful , objective feedback , as shown in the memo attached below .
we will produce a stable code with the changes kim and her team have requested before the package is released outside the building .
i have also asked kathryn to perform more testing within the cl team before asking kim and her team ( or any other clients ) to play with the changes . performing significant changes overnight , and then showing the code to clients the next morning is wonderfully responsive , but a little too risky .
the high - level demo scheduled for thursday will show code that is already frozen and hardened .
all the best ,
tom

subject : update on confirmlogic
i wanted to give you a quick update on confirmlogic . . . .
testing was done last week on the confirmlogic module . on thursday , we discussed with kathryn cordes and the confirmlogic it team the items that we had found that were " show stoppers " as far as releasing the product for beta testing . some of the major items found were the inability to properly handle basis swaps for gas and inability to display meaningful index references for power ( they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the index ) .
the team worked on the " fixes " and migrated the code last night . today during testing , they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information , which was working previously . i talked to kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code . she said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine . we plan more testing in the morning .
they are doing a high - level demo this thursday for beta customers just to introduce the module . they were planning on having more extensive beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further .
we have told them that we would not sign off for beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working . we need consistent , stable days of testing before i will feel comfortable .
overall , we like the " new " streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues .
call with any questions .
