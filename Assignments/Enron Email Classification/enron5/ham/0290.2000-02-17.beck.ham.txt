Subject: tokyo staffing
joe -
as a follow up on our meeting last week , i ' m working with rick causey and
caos for ena and enron europe to identify potential candidates and to refine
our job description for the local hire we want to recruit permanently . rick
wants to be closely involved in those decisions . would you please forward to
me some of the handouts you had with you or may have updated by now that
address the business environment , gantt chart / timeline , office scope , timing
of business transactions etc . to aid in communicating tokyo needs ? i ' m not
sure if you sent anything to sally , but i don ' t believe i ' ve seen anything
yet .
thank you ,
cassandra .
