louise ,
i have attached a draft of the newly revised report on our test results of
the eol management report for your review . please keep in mind this is a
tentative draft . mark and andrew still want to perform some qa on the
results and torrey is still looking into some of the observations .
to summarize , we observed a significant improvement from the last test we
performed a few months ago . the systemic problems that created a large
volume of the discrepancies in our previous testing have been greatly
reduced . the majority of the discrepancies identified in the most recent
testing are primarily a result of random data entry errors and some deal
booking changes made in the back office without the product control group ' s
knowledge . torrey has already corrected the most significant discrepancies
and is continuing to investigate the smaller items .
andrew and i will both be on vacation for the week of august 28 . when we
return , we will set up a meeting with you and dave to discuss the final
results once torrey has had time to conclude his research .
