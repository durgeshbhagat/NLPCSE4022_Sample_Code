Subject: latest agenda - please don ' t distribute
hello folks -
brent and i have updated the agenda for the changes we made the other night .
i am sending this to you for your own use . remember that we will walk
through this again on sunday night to make sure we ' re still on the right
track .
please don ' t distribute the agenda or share it with the session
participants . i ' m sure they are starting to ask the question - " so , what are
we going to do while we ' re there ? " - in fact i ' ve had folks ask me that
already . my typical response is to reiterate the goals of the session and
explain that we will do a series of exercies in both large and small group
formats . and , when they continue to press for more ( as i ' ve found they
typically do ) - i politely let them know that more details will be shared
when we kick off the session on monday morning . now , if they are curious
about what an ase is and why they have to go to dallas for it , you can cover
that too or have them call me .
team , i think we ' re really close to being ready . i ' m going to spend the rest
of the day pulling together our input documents so if you have anything you
want included send it on !
let me know if you have any questions !
