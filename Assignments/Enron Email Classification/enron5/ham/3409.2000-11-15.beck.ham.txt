dear kathy & darren ,
i ' ve spoken with marcelo parra here in new york regarding phone
recording for the enron metals offices . the rac group insists that recording
is done asap and i need to report back to marcelo the install dates of the
equipment in montreal and st . louis . if you have such info or know who is
responsible , please let me know .
i understand that we are several months away from the installation of a
new switch with central recording capability here at the 520 madison office
in new york . as an alternative , i can install a refurbished digital
recording system for 24 telephones on the concentrates and metals trading
desks for approximately $ 45 , 000 . the recording device will be located in
our telephone room and is not accessible to the traders . all equipment is in
stock and we can have the desks recorded by december 1 . i need a quick
approval since the vendor will only hold refurbished equipment until friday
afternoon for us . barry , can you give the ok ?
also , recording for the chicago office should not be an issue since the
enron metals people are moving to the existing enron chicago facilities
before the end of the year .
best regards ,
mike
