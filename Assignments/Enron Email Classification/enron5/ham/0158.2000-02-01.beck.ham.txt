the view from frevert and sherriff is that you should lead the discussion on
this .
is this still okay with you ?

sharron ,
please find attached the presentation for the meeting on helsinki with joe
sutton at 8 . 30 am ( there have been some minor changes from earlier versions ) .
would you print off enough colour copies for the houston attendees ?
i also attach a supplementary document which may not be required in the
meeting , but it would be useful if a number of copies could be to hand just
in case .
many thanks
fernley
