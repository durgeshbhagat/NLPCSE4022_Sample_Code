dear paul ,
thanks for the update . can you liase with al pennisi and marcelo parra to
look at the r & n information ? we are trying to get a handle on how
comfortable we are outsourcing the majority of the middle office for the us
brokerage business . not just settlements , but nearly all functions . al is
putting together some information regarding r & n . together with al , kevin
rhodes and marcelo we should be able to come to a recommendation ( either the
middle office operations is something we should start to do ourselves , or
that we think it is best to continue to use r & n as an outsourcer for the
brokerage business ) .
if you want to discuss call me at 713 853 9123 .
regards
shona

hi shona ,
ideally i think will morley ( recent hire to london documentation team ) should
be looking after the documentation area as he is managing the london
side ( i will confirm this )
on the settlements side i am happy to look at the rolfe & nowlan side as i
have around 10 years experience using and developing r & n in my
previous employments
thanks
