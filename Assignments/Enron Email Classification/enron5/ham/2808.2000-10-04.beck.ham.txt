Subject: rac risk reporting
currently , members of ted murphy ' s group have been preparing certain
non - standard reports at the request of commercial . these reports can be
categorized as :
" morning report " - daily
component v @ r - daily
adhoc v @ r - as needed
book reconciliation - as needed
stress testing - as needed
back testing - weekly
correlation matrix - bi - weekly
i have obtained a copy of all reports currently being prepared . in the
upcoming weeks we need to transfer the preparation of these reports from rac
to risk operations . in order to do that , on a report by report basis , we
need to determine what group within risk operations should prepare these
reports ( risk management and controls or the individual commodity risk
management groups ) .
in the next couple days , i will be sending you each a listing of reports
prepared , and then set up a time to meet with you so we can determine the
best way to go forward .
best regards
shona
