Subject: how about lunch ?
hi sally ,
am assuming you got the ou stickers for your new vehicle and that david has
already put them on by now .
i will be in houston the end of this month ( may 30 - june 2 ) and would like
to take you to lunch if possible and get caught up on everything . i have
also asked mike mcconnell to join us if possible . hopefully the two of you
have a free day available for lunch and can coordinate a time and day . let
me know if and when the two of you would be available and i will schedule
around your plans .
i guess michelle , clay and blake will have been there for a week when i am
there . i was sad to see george leave the recruiting side , as he really did
a good job of promoting enron to both ou and my students . i know he will do
a great job at enron online .
hope all is going well with your father and that you are not constantly
traveling around the world and being away from your family .
look forward to hopefully seeing you later this month .
