subject : risk trac clarification
just to clarify , i believed you would like me to document the process of the
feeds from the deal capture and valuation systems ( power 99 etc . ) into the
risk trac database which flows through to cas .
david hardy was not in the meeting today , but oliver gaylard made a good
point that simon sear ( ie the strategic initiatives ) group may be doing this ,
do you want me to continue with this ?
kind regards
