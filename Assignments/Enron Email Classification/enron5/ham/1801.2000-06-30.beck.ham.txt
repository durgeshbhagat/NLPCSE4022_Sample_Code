i am trying to determine themes ( objectives ) for my visit next week . one
major theme is our attempt to move forward the plans for middle office
infrastructure development to eliminate volume sensitivity .
i hope to cover the below document in our meetings - you will see that i have
tentatively included you as a business sponsor for the initiative - i hope
you not think this is too forward of me !
cheers

all
many thanks for your comments of the draft , i have incorporated these into
the first version attached below .
as mentioned , this is a ' light ' version without all the individual feed
details and system names etc . intended as an summary for sign - off .
i will tidy up the heavy version so that it can be used to build the
elaboration and planning documents .
mike is going to present this to fernley and to sally beck for discussion on
his trip to houston next week .
i will send to beth for her sign off .
we need to consider how to wrap mark pickering in and to ensure his support ,
booking enlighten ' s place on the it priority list .
any comments welcome .
thanks & regards
