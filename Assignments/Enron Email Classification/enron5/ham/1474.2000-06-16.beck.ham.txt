mike ,
as a vision statement this looks like an excellent place to start . you might
want to think about the relationship between business units ( eel , ees and ebs
- a little political , but what the hell ) and with global risk management
operations . it might also be worth mentioning the standards that we are
developing and which we will operate by .
good luck .
