subject : global systems review - completion of work , closing meeting
fyi , my comments are :
sap interface - we discussed an improved solution for implementation in 4 th
quarter earlier this week
inactive employees , etc - in the absence of a corporate process for keeping
this updated , the global managers do periodically review who has access and
request changes to access based upon their knowledge of current employee
assignments . at best , this is a quarterly process .
passwords - they are right . we probably need something .
