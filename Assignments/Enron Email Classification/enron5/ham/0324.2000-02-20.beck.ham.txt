Subject: third report on helsinki office
steve ,
i am still a little out of it from my travels , but let me take a first shot
at my reaction to this :
i think we ought to at least challenge the notion that the mark - to - market
exposure is so arcane as to be dismissed . generally , time is of the essence
in most contractual relationships and the value of that time should take into
account both time value of money and the value of the underlying at critical
times .
i think that rac should be deeply involved in setting negotiating strategy
and be part of any decisions made .
i will add to this if and when the haze clears up .
