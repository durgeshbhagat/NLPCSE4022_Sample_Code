Subject: re : book - split update 4 / 27 / 2000
sally ,
i wanted to forward the latest update for the book - split project . although
you may not find the details of the update to be that exciting , i want you to
know that much work and time are being put into this effort . paul and gregor
are the two desk directors for continental power who report to joe gold .
it ' s good to hear some feedback from them .
as you know , kristin has now shown some interest in the ebs job with barry
now that fallen is moving . when barry and i first spoke about the position
which i would fill , i told him the fallen might want kristin since he knows
her and has worked with her the last 2 years . although the job sounds
interesting ( barry ' s a good salesman ) , there is not room for both kristin and
myself . i ' ll keep you updated on my discussions with barry .
thanks for being a sounding board ,
todd

due to the announcement that the london office received pertaining to the may
day problems which occurred last year , the book - split " go live " date will be
postponed until next saturday , may 6 . listed below are the updates since the
last memo :
book - split
completed
position report which presents peak / off - peak volumes by month , by desk was
delivered to paul and gregor
deal summaries which support the position report were also delivered
all volumetric variances between the production and test environments have
been identified - the material differences were related to 2 counterparties
which were not set up in test and steps have been taken to resolve this issue

separate dprs and associated reports for the pool and bilateral portfolios
testing of the settlements invoicing system
transmission
talks have continued with the houston it team as to the transmission deal
type testing that must be done . the it group moved floors yesterday and has
spent much of today recovering from the aftermath . they are aware of the
sense of urgency and level of priority to give this issue and considerable
progress should be made during the next 2 weeks .
other
neil has been working with miles in order to set up the necessary cezch
border curves so that the cez deal may be properly booked in enpower . once
this is complete , the basis adjustment ( approx . 14 m eur ) can be removed from
the dpr . also , the financial iberian positions have successfully been
intergrated into the current continental power dpr ( leaving only the spanish
physical deals being valued outside of enpower ) .
please come by if you have any questions ,
