subject : global standards - additional info
i ' ve received some feedback from some of you concerning the depth of the
global standards as attached . these standards are meant to represent basic ,
high level standards that each office must adhere to . additionally , these
standards are applicable to each and every business enron has . they are not
meant to be an exhaustive list of all enron standards .
i believe that each of you will have additional standards for which you would
like to establish exception reporting that are focused to your individual
business . we can certainly discuss these , and possibly incorporate them as
additional standards once these basics are addressed ( a possible " phase ii " ) .
i ' m in london this week and you can reach me at 44 777 528 3633 if you want
to discuss this with me .
thanks ,
shona
as i discussed in the staff meeting , i am sending you the global standards
for your review and comment . please review these standards to determine if :
the targets set are reasonable for your business and
as minimum standards , they are comprehensive enough ( if you would like to see
additional reporting )
lastly , in the upcoming month we will start to implement exception reporting
for these standards . please let us know who the key contact in your
department would be for this implementation .
please address all correspondence to michael moscoso .
thank you ,
shona
