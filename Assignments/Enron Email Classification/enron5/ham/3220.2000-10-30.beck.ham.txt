Subject: pre - prc meeting
hi sally ,
i hope this note finds you well . i wanted to get in touch with you as the
prc process begins to take off . i was hoping we could meet briefly at
sometime in the next couple of weeks . i rotated into a new group ( u . s .
network development ) in late august and am doing very different work within
ebs . i would welcome the chance to share some of this and other thoughts of
mine with you . my schedule is quite flexible , so if there is a time that is
convenient with you , please let me know and i ' ll stop by . probably 15
mintues would be adequate .
thank you , and i hope to see you soon .
