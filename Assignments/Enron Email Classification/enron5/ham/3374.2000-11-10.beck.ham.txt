sally ,
chris hanz has blocked his entire day out today for technology recruiting -
therefore he said that he would be able to meet with john from 1 : 30 - 2 : 00
just before a recruiting event for office visits at 2 : 00 . therefore , lexi is
going to bring and pick up both chris hoyle and john rodgers as indicated
below :
chris hoyle ebl 812 11 : 00 a . m . - 11 : 30 a . m .
john rodgers ebl 812 1 : 30 p . m . - 2 : 00 p . m .
thanks !

hoyle . if you don ' t get anyone to talk with john rodgers , don ' t worry about
it . i may have someone that could talk with him from the enrononline team .
