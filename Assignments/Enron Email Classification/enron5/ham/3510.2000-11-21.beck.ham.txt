Subject: re : dpr adjustments for uk power
from the risk management perspective i would like to add the following
comments :
uk power - despite much testing we still have a few production teething
problems with the transfer to enpower and this was the first full live day .
the specific issues surrounding the o 30 m adjustment is being investigated by
it and we hope to have a definitive answer tomorrow .
continental power - the portcalc valuation failed 4 times as a result of it
problems resulting is us missing the deadline .
oslo - the officialisation was at 10 . 56 london time against a deadline of
11 . 00 .

james ,
it appears only the uk gas mtm made it for the v @ r run in houston today .
uk power : ( despite the spotlight being on this feed due to the first run of
the new evaluation system ) was officialised late and required the below
mentioned adjustment .
contintental power : officialised late ?
nordic power : was officialised around 11 am london time - the slowness of the
current feed to houston prevented the feed reaching there on time ( feed has
been rewritten by it to speed up the process and is currently in uat )
however , it appears the normal time for officialisation this book is around
10 . 30 am which allows the feed to hit to normally hit on time .
appreciate if you could looked into the above .
regards
david

we have a topside adjustment to put through of o ( 30 , 164 , 151 ) against south
western electricity plc . this is due to pd deal eo 00535 , peer id 41957 being
valued in enpower when it was supposed to be excluded from the mtm .
