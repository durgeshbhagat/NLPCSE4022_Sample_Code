proposed list - of all potential candidates
myself
james new - and his lead risk managers
mike wellings - uk power
coralie evans - continental power
robert yeo - uk and continental gas
paul d ' arcy - structured products
david wall - credit
tim poullain - patterson - metals integration
andrew cornfield - metals risk manager
kevin rhodes - metals controller ( there are in fact two controllers at
present kevin for financial trading and howard carter for merchanting )
i would leave ralph jaeger of frankfurt out of the offsite if places are
restricted - he is covered by the mainstream accounting conferences , but i
would have jan erland , and heidi and tiong hock from singapore .
i am not sure fernley would want to be there - but i can ask .
on others - simon thurbin of liquids in london should be in houston and
would be a good choice for inclusion . brent may want his two london
controllers of cindy horn and kenny nicoll to also come
would you invite kristen to come with ( in place of barry ? ) .
a long list ( and we may want to cut back ) but all these individuals carry
the burden of operational risk assessment and management - standardising that
process would be an achievement indeed .

ps - shall we revisit agenda and discuss who should start preparing
presentations - we had thought about engaging rac , it etc
