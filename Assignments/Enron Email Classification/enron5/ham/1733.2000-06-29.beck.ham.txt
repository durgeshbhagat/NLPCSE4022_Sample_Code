hey ken ,
i just wanted to let you know that the financial settlement group were very
impressed with unify during the first training class that we had on friday .
i did not hear any negative comments , and they even said they liked it better
than sift . some of the key areas in which they see great benefit are :
1 . the automatic calculation of in and out of the money options
2 . the statement group assignment screen and the idea of selecting different
statement groups for different payment terms
3 . the ability to sort and subtotal on financial list screen
4 . the system is more efficient than sift
5 . the ability to view the invoice on screeen and to click directly on the
line to make adjustments
6 . the ability to wire foreign currencies ( really and sap enhancement )
one thing that i did hear is that they wished they could see enron north
america and ena global together on the financial list screen .
i think the development group did a great job , and i enjoyed working with
everyone . i hope that in the next few weeks and months ahead that you will
continue to allow the team to provide our group with quick and efficient
response to areas of concern and enhancements .
thank you to the group for all of your hard work ,
becky
