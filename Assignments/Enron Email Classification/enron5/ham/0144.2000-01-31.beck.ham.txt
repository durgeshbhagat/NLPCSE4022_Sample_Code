rick ,
the attached report is an updated version of the document we discussed on
friday of last week . some of the numbers in the exposure analysis are still
draft and i expect firm numbers in the next few hours .
my aim would be to streamline this report for the presentation to joe sutton ,
but i would welcome your steer on how you plan to conduct the meeting and
whether or not this format is appropriate .
regards
fernley
