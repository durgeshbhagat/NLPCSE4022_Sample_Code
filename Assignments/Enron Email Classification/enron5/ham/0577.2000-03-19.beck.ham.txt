Subject: sunday news
hi sally ,
i need to be working on my newest project , for which we went to hallettsville
this week , and tomorrow is garden club , and i am almost through as president .
i will not preside in april , as i have a conflict - new secretary in colonial
dames and then all we have left in garden club will be our may luncheon .
being presdent has not been too bad , as all of the ladies are very helpful .
my project is the completion of our papers for the recognition of our
cemetery by the state historic commissson . that is why we were in
hallettville . hope to get that done by tuesday - there are many attachments
necessary . we stayed in a bed and breakfast , which was fair but not
oustanding breakfast . i ran by to see dot for a few minutes before we headed
home . mary had spent sunday night with us to go with us and we met our
cousin from missouri city also .
enough of that , this will be a great quick way to communicate . i am glad
cindy gave me your address . hope you have had a great week - end . i will
write more another time .
love ,
mom ( almost signed it sue )
