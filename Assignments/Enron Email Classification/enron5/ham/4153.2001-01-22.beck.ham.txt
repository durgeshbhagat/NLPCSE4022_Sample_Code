louise ,
i don ' t think i have seen you this year - happy new year !
i have been asked what company name should be put on the business cards of
some of sally beck ' s group . i have been telling most people to stick with
they organisation names e . g . enron north america or enron south america ,
rather than enron americas / enron wholesale services . do you want everybody
to use enron net works , or should the trading support groups use their
business unit names ena , egm , eim ?
see you soon .
