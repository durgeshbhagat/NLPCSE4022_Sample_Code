i wanted to provide an update on our progress with aec . bryce baxter and his
team members have been in contact with mike bennett and bill hogue to
understand their needs . we have provided the initial information they
requested ( i . e . , one month of data ) , and are awaiting their approval before
completing the analysis on the remaining months . i am confident that we have
established clear points of contact within settlements for mike and bill and
we will continue to work on solidifying the relationship .
please let me know if you have any questions .
