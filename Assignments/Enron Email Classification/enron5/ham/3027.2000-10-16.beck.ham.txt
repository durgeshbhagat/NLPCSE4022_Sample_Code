sheri ,
it was a pleasure speaking with you today . attached is the ice new user
enrollment form . this is the means by which you can identify the
individuals that are to be set up as ice users and the level of access ( user
type ) to be granted to each . of particular importance is the identification
of the individuals who will be acting as the primary administrative , credit ,
it , and invoicing contacts for .
you will need to complete a separate form for each enron entity that
executed a participant agreement .
if you have any questions , please call me at 770 . 738 . 2129 . thanks for your
interest and we look forward to serving you .
