beauty of a woman -
the beauty of a woman
is not in the clothes she wears ,
the figure she carries
or the way she combs her hair .
the beauty of a woman
must be seen from her eyes ,
because that is the doorway to her heart ,
the place where love resides .
the beauty of a woman
is not in a facial mole ,
but true beauty in a woman
is reflected in her soul .
it is the caring that she lovingly gives
the passion that she shows ,
the beauty of a woman
with passing years - only grows .

without her , man is nothing . "
