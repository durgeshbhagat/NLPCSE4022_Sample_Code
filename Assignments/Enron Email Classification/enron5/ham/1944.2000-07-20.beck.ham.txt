tom ,
per our conversation a week or so ago , i am forwarding a file to you which
provides the hours worked during the month of may for each activity performed
in the confirmation process . these hours are for multiple rc ' s across the
various functions that are in energy operations . the hours are provided by
the people responsible for the rc ' s ; however , in many cases are rough
estimates . the data provided is directionally correct .
the excel file attached has several tabs . when you open the file you should
at the confirmation tab .
if you have any questions , need any clarification or would like to set up a
time for us to walk you through the information , please call me at ext . 39641
or shari mao at ext . 33859 .

james ,
attached is a spreadsheet that highlights the number of hours that are spent
on activities per rc . i ' ve only created custom views for risk management ,
confirmations , and settlements ( vm and lo are gas specific , and the other
functions are deemed non - energy operational core processes )
let me know if you have any questions about the data .
thanks ,
shari
