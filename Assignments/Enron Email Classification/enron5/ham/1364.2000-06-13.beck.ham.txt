Subject: benchmark
fyi . . . according to jeff , by the end of today the only position that will
require manual adjustment is an im canada position ( 60 k ' s ) that will be
fixed next monday when kam keiser goes back to calgary . everything else is
now automatically feeding to the grms system ( and var calculations ) without
human intervention .

steve - mike asked me to send him a list of what we had done to improve the
top - level adjustments on the benchmark . here are the things which we
discussed earlier .
mike - let me know if you need anything else .
we have lowered the number of top - level adjustments substantially this week .
we have taken several steps in order to achieve this .
1 . we had to adjust formatting in all text files which go into grms .
2 . we are using a flip - out book for all canadian deals done with the u . s .
office so that canadian positions are pulling in correctly .
3 . we had to adjust many book names in order that grms would pull the books
into the system .
4 . we had to change region codes in the system so that grms would pull in
more than one book per region .
issues remaining :
intra - month canada
chicago
storage and intra - east
intra - month canada - we have a risk person from the u . s . office going to
canada on monday to fix their problems .
chicago - will be fixed by the end of the day . system is looking for the
wrong portfolio code .
storage and intra - east - also will be fixed by the end of the day . overide
books need to be set up .
thanks
