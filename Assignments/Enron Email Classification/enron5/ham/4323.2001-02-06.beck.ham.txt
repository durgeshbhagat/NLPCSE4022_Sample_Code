Subject: distribution version of risk mgmt policy
i ' m not sure how or if you ' re planning on distributing to the business unit
controllers or other ops people the updated risk management policy , but i ' m
attaching a version without the limit amounts as this is what we use to
distribute to people outside our group ( of course we tell traders their own
specific limits , and the top guys can see the consolidated dpr , but for
everyone else we provide it without limits ) . i did send it to wanda curry
and barry pearce , but i ' m not sending it to anyone in your org chart unless
you ' d like me to . i ' d like to get this out on the rac website , but since
it ' s a work in progress , i think it might be a while .
regards ,
cassandra .
