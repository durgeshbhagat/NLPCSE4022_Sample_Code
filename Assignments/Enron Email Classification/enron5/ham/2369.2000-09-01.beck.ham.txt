subject : mg : mo / bo functional groups and reporting lines
please find attached a workbook comprising two worksheets . these worksheets
illustrate how support for the london based mg businesses - financial trading
and merchanting - plug in to the enron europe framework .
org
this sheet illustrates the main reporting lines for the front , middle and
back office ( s ) up to the " office of the chair " for enron europe . though the
mechanting business is used for illustrative purposes , for financial trading
simply substitute mike farmer and howard carter with michael hutchinson and
kevin rhodes respectively .
staff
this sheet simply attaches names to each of the middle and back office
functional groups indicated in the sheet entitled org . staff within the
middle office functional groups have been introduced to the dual reporting
concept whereby they report to both the business controller and functional
lead .
the intention is that quite soon after moving into enron house the functional
teams for both financial trading and mechanting will start to more closely
together . the influence of the functional leads should ensure that these
teams are blended into a generic enron metals support group , where possible
leveraging across the other trading support groups .
any questions , please call x 34264 .
regards ,
tim
