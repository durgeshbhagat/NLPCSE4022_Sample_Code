Subject: global standards task force - status and going forward
i thank you all for volunteering to be members of the global standards task
force . to keep you up to date on what is going on :
i am receiving sporadic reporting from most groups .
i have hired someone to be dedicated to this process ( starting 1 / 1 / 01 - until
then , it is me and one person starting 12 / 11 who can dedicate some time )
the key focus is report aol and getting that consolidated - i am taking a
stab at it today .
i am meeting with an access programmer to develop a reporting tool to replace
the current excel format
by the end of the year my goal is to have daily reporting from all groups , to
have someone dedicated to review this daily reporting and raise issues , and
to have a dedicated it person developing the access database , to have weekly
consolidated reporting for aol , to determine the appropriate time frames for
reporting escalation and audience
what i would like the task force to concentrate on is to :
help review the individual reporting to determine if :
it is adequate
where we should go from the current reporting guidelines
decide on appropriate audiences and levels for issue communication
decide on reporting formats
steer the process
i will send you copies of the reporting for the next couple of days so you
can get an understanding of what i am receiving and the problems people are
having . let me know your thoughts and concerns and i will consolidate them
and then we can discuss them as part of the task force .
best regards
shona
