Subject: cp follow - up
i am writing you in order to report the latest developments in relation to my
visit in september . i forwarded the attached file to james new and mike
jordan several weeks ago and had hoped to discuss it with them . i have had
no response and , therefore , i assume that they agree with the direction that
was laid out in the departure meeting ( sept . 15 ) with gregor , paul , and risk
personnel .
the three areas addressed in the report are as follows :
pool book p & l split
enpower structure modification
transmission valuation
pool book p & l split
i have spoken to anthony macdonald about the progress and as i understand , he
has offered to devote time in order to inform james and coralie evans about
the underlying problem .
enpower structure modification
paul can certainly give you a more detailed understanding as to the legal
entity decision process and amount of rework time that is required of your
risk and confirmation groups . i have discussed this problem with zhiyong wei
( houston ' s enpower support ) in order to inform him of the situation and paul
mentioned that he has also spoken with brian hudson .
transmission
as of my last communication with houston it , the testing was almost
complete . at the departure meeting mentioned above , we considered valuation
of transmission as a spread - option to be plan a and further agreed upon a
plan b and c . the report details the operational risk involved in valuing
transmission by using the forwards deal type in enpower .
since i have communicated with james and mike and now with the 3 of you , i
have completed my responsibilities on this project . we have now formalized a
direction with backup plans and i would encourage testing by the london
office to ensure that what meets the west power desk ' s needs will also
address yours . if you need to further discuss this report , feel free to call
or set up a meeting .
regards ,
todd hall
