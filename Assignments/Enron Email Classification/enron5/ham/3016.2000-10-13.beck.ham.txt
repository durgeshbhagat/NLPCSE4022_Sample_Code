Subject: enron europe remote offices - note specific to sally
dear sally ,
just to keep you in the loop , naomi ' s group is responsible for all of the
enron europe remote offices and is a great resource to keep us updated on
what each office is really doing . we are hoping her group can help us
determine which offices have origination / trading or are near doing these
types of activities , as well as what offices have other activities .
we are putting together a short checklist that her team will fill out for
each office . based on that , we can determine whether to scope the office
into our doorstep review .
thanks
shona

dear naomi ,
as always - good talking to you yesterday . based on the discussions you and
i have had recently , cassandra and i are in the process of drafting a process
whereby we receive information from you and your group to help update our
understanding of the enron europe remote offices . this will allow us to
better determine which offices to scope into the doorstep review and
hopefully lessen the doorstep work required from mike ' s resources .
i ' ll send something to you early next week .
have a good weekend ,
shona
