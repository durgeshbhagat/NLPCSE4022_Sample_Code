lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing enpower in south america until
business activity increases enough to support it .
based on below , we will start looking for someone with strong access / excel
knowledge to come up with a different solution . everyone will have to
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines .

richard / beth , we have been asked by risk to get argentina started on
enpower . are you ok with us moving on this ? a couple things to consider . . .
our instance strategy for enpower is determined by geographic location
( bandwidth ) , volumes , and market similarity ( functionality ) . based on this ,
i want to set south america up on their own instance . enpower will have the
following instances long term : eur , us , cnd , sa , aus , jpn , ind . we will
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model .
there is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance ,
however , i am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a
production environment that will eventually need to be split .
glad to discuss . . . please respond quickly , as we are waiting to pull the
trigger on this . . .
steve

currently , the argentine power group has in total about 20 physical forward
deals which will be done under enron comercializadora de energia argentina
s . a . ( co . 027 w ) and one financial deal which will be done under enron north
america ( co . 0364 ) . given the fact that we ' ll also have deals on ena , i would
think that we could be on the houston server . just let us know .
in the mean time , we ' ll be working with the various global groups to have the
proper desk , portfolio , facilities etc . . . . set up .
thanks for your help ,
