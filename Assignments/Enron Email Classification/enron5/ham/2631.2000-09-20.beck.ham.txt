Subject: growth statistics
sally ,
jeff skilling mentioned today that gas volume growth in ena was still about
97 % year on year .
i don ' t know how much of this is increased number of trades and how much is
increased volume per trade .
we are currently preparing a zero - base estimate of future support costs to
assess the benefits v costs of all projects .
assuming that the business in europe will develop in a similar way to
america , but a few years behind , it would be most useful to have some more
statistics for several years back .
who in your team has some more statistics on numbers of trades which could
help us ?
many thanks ,
richard
