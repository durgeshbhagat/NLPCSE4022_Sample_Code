Subject: re : aep - hpl standing meeting
brian ,
this was not a replacement for any meeting . i had intented this to be a working / decision making / resolution meeting
for energy ops .
i have a group of people working on various issues that are interdependent . this was a chance for
them to hear progress from the different areas . we included it because most of our issues are dependent
on them completing certain items before we can move ahead .
thanks

bob / tommy : great idea - we should be able to keep it to under an hour ( 12 : 00 - 1 : 00 ) . i will pay for lunch . lets keep it focused on it / business ops / trading issues so we don ' t duplicate the general meeting we have on tuesday ' s .
jim / lillian : please replace the daily transition update meeting on wednesday ' s with this meeting .
regards ,
brian

bob : this is a great idea . this will allow us to focus on the systems development and testing across it and the users . it also keeps the heat on for everyone to show progress and communicate issues . - tommy

subject : aep - hpl standing meeting
i think it is about time we establish a standing meeting for issues and updates .
after a brief discussion , it looks like wednesdays over lunch is the best time .
i will have heather find a large conference room .
the meeting will start at 11 : 30 and hopefully be concluded by 1 : 30 .
location will follow on monday .
thanks
bob
please pass this memo to people that should be included .
just have them let heather know who will be attending so she can order food .
thanks
