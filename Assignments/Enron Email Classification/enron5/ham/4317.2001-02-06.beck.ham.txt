everything sounds good , but can we use . html instead ? . htm doesn ' t work on
linux web servers , and it ' s best to be universal , in case they want to
deploy in diff . contexts .

subject : path names , file extentions
so that we can avoid last minute " oh my gosh we ' ve used different file
structures / naming convention - - quick we need to change all of these paths in
the next ten minutes " , can we do the following ?
all html files will be considered as in the root directory and will use the
extension of " . htm "
subdirectories / folders :
images - - images for sales guide and intro and any image that is used
throughout the deliverable , such as logos , navigation buttons , etc . so an
example would be : images / dell _ logo . gif
scripts - - one script folder for all of the coursebuilder scripts used in the
deliverable
timer - - for the timer interaction that daniel is building
images / mollie - - for images specific to mollie pages ( this way if we have more
than one drag / drop we won ' t have to rename any coursebuilder created
images / targets , etc .
images / warren
images / sally
images / david
will this work for everyone ? if not , please let me know and i will send out
modifications .
