hi sally
thanks for the attached . in light of your response i think i ' m after 2
things :
1 . a spec that outlines eugenio ' s role , and
2 . a spec that could be used to hire a japanese national to replace
eugenio at the end of eugenio ' s assignment in japan .
hope this helps . if you could revert asap i ' d appreciate it .
thanks
phil

i am in london this week and have picked up your message with the
attachment . if you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do
with this , then i will be glad to help you where i can . are you trying to
create a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in
japan ? do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a
position on the tokyo team ? is this a job description that you want to use
in discussions that we may have with eugenio perez in a start up role for the
risk books ? these three options would all require slightly different
descriptions of the role , so it would be helpful to know how you will use
this .
please let me know and i will be glad to work on this for you .
