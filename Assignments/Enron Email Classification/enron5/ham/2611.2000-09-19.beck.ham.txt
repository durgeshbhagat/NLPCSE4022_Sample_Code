rick , rick ,
there are three mg offices in north america outside new york which , previous
to the acquisition by enron , acted much as trading offices . they are very
small .
we have worked with the people in metals to put in place extra controls so
that they are not trading offices , for example having a trader in a
designated trading office own each book and sign off on profit daily .
this process has highlighted the fact that our non - trading offices are not
all the same , and cannot reasonably all be the same .
some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground , some
originate ( get a price from a trading office for every deal ) , and some
execute for trading offices ( are given a range within which they can execute
trades ) .
is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit .
tab ' office models ' shows which functions are performed in which type of
office
tab ' office list ' shows the actual offices involved
we propose to re - examine this methodology in 6 months ' time .
buy - in has been obtained from the cc list and the people on the ground .
it is worth noting that this approach would have caught helsinki , except for
the contract - in - a - bottom - drawer , but no system of control can reliably catch
that , as was evidenced by eott .
are you both happy with this approach ?
are there any extra controls you would like to see in place ?
thanks ,
richard
