subject : new profit centers
bob ,
per our conversation - on this past tuesday , a group met from vm , gas acctg .
and east risk to discuss the recording of the 12 east desks and 7 central
desks to sap . effective with march flow , each desks for central and east will
record to its own profit center in sap ( the wellhead desks and texas were
done in feb . ' s g / l ) . according to gas acct . , they will calculate ua for each
of the profit centers ( 19 in total ) . as we discussed , vm does not have the
appropriate unify reports or manpower to support this level of accounting at
this time and for this month will continue to tie ua 4 out as we have in the
past using our same reports - gas acct . will have to sum their side of the
ua 4 calc . to match us . with the foresight of eventually going to profit
center level accouting and reporting , there will need to be significant
changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle this lower
level of reporting . i believe the flash is already being done at the
different profit centers , but all the downstream groups are still performing
their analysis at a more consolidated level . there were discussions in the
meeting that oa would not go to this lower level , but i am of the opinion
that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across the
organization - so if this is the path we take , then everyone ' s process will
need to be able to handle this level of detail . of course , no decisions were
made in our meeting , and as i stated , for now , vm ' s process will remain
unchanged for this month . please let me know if you want to discuss
further . thanks !
