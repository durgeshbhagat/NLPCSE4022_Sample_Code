Subject: system outage nomination impact , follow - up
as of 10 : 00 am thursday pipeline reports indicate that all of our resubmitted
nominations have been confirmed by the pipelines and our counterparties and
will be scheduled correctly . these nominations were resubmitted on the first
intraday cycle ( 6 : 00 pm on the day prior to flow ) .
as a result i do not expect any monetary impact from yesterdays outage . i
will keep you posted if anything further develops .
