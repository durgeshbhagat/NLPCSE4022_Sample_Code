subject : supervisory leadership classes
by now , you should be aware of the supervisory leadership curriculum rolled
out by greg whalley a couple of weeks ago ( see the posters in our elevator
banks ) . this curriculum was designed at the request of senior management to
provide new and future leaders the opportunity to prepare for such roles .
feedback from the program administrators is that there has been a low
response rate . this may be due to confusion about eligibility and cost .
just to clarify - all of you are eligible to participate . in fact , you are
strongly encouraged to participate . further , those individuals within your
groups that are leading efforts or are expected to step into such a role are
encouraged to participate . please keep in mind that individuals don ' t
currently have to be supervisors to attend the training ; the idea is to
provide training for new situations encountered as leaders . generally
speaking , those at the specialist level and above should be considered for
these classes - just use your judgment .
although there is a cost associated with these classes , it is minimal in
comparison to the returns that can be gained through participation .
guidelines are available to help you target specific needs for yourself and
your staff . please contact the training department to obtain a curriculum
guide .
let me know if you have any questions .
thanks ,
susan
