Subject: after last weeks volatility in the natural gas market , i think we all agreed
it is imperative that the trading , risk controls , and reporting groups
understand how eack group looks at risk , and how we manage the process .
while our processes are generally good , in times of extreme price and / or
volatility environments , we all could be more coordinated . it is apparent
now that we must get together to look at all aspects of it resources and
intraday price risk and var management since it seems these are not now , but
should be the same thing . i would like to set up a meeting regarding these
and other management issues and will be in touch . i appreciate everyone ' s
help .
