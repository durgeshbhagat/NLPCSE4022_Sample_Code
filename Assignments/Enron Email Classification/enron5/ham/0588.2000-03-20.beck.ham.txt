Subject: eol reporting database
dear sally :
i am a new member of jay webb ' s enrononline technical team . in my role , i
have had the opportunity to review the eol reporting database created by
eugenio perez . eugenio has demonstrated good technical and problem solving
skills in the development of the reporting database . he was able to apply
his knowledge of microsoft access and expand his programming skills . he
quickly developed an application that served the immediate needs of eol .
eugenio should be commended for growing his technical skills to develop his
first access application .
sincerely ,
