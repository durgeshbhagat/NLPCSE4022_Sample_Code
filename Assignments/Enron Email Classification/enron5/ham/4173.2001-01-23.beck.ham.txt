subject : 2001 anticipated budget adjustments for hpl sale
during the budgeting process for 2001 i gave dave delainey an estimated cost
savings for energy operations assuming the sale of hpl . since this is clearly
on the horizon , we need to take a close look at opportunities for cost
savings and our estimated timing on those savings . i will ask james by copy
of this memo to set up a meeting late this week to cover this . i want to be
able to get back with dave with more detailed estimates of cost savings .
