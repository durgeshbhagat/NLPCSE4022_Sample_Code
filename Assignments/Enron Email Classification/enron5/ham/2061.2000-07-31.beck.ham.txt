subject : tracking problem
hey guys i need your help
there is one topic that we still can ' t seem to get taken care of : s 2 mlt 2 .
sally rewrote the storyboards and , according to my understanding , it was
handed off to emrul and then cindy fixed the html pages for the revised
content . but on the server we still have the old version of these files .
what is going on with these files ? gerry would you be able to figure out
what ' s happening ? did it get to emrul ? did it get to cindy ? did it get
posted ? did older versions get copied over the newer versions ?
we * need * to get this topic done for review - - it was due to linda almost a
week ago . can you please let me know when it ' s ready for my review and edit ,
so we can get it out to linda .
thanks ,
warren
