wellesley campus plan
- we discussed the presentation time being pushed back . i was able to get
it pushed back to 5 : 00 o ' clock at the latest . there are other companies
scheduled to present on that date and that was the latest time we coud get .
there will be no class conflicts on that date ( september 28 , 2000 ) . we
discussed the attire for the presentation being casual ( jeans ) . that concept
was proposed to the career placement center assistant ( bernice tita ) and
she said that casual attire will be well received . we would need to just
indicate it when we publicize the event .
