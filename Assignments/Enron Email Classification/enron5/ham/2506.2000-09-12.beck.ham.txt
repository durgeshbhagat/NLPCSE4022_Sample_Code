hi nicki ,
thanks for setting up the meeting next wednesday ( 9 / 20 ) at 2 : 30 with m .
frevert , d . delainey , j . shankman , and j . lavorato . here is a brief overview
of the meeting objective :
purpose
to gain support and approval for a data warehouse vision containing
consolidated trade information with centralized access .
background
the definition of a data warehouse is a place to consolidate information
originating from multiple transaction processing systems and platforms into a
common database repository . the idea of an enron  & trade warehouse  8
originated from members of the london office and has been expanded to include
the houston systems . the need for a trade warehouse stems from the
requirement of multiple departments needing to access consolidated deal
information for analytical reporting and down - stream processing . currently ,
deal information is held in separate trading systems both within product
process flows from mid to back office , and across product lines . the
information is also stored across multiple system platforms and is not easily
accessible or consistently presented across the various trading products
within enron . given this current architecture , it is very difficult and
costly to access timely , quality - assured , and consolidated cross - product deal
information for analytical reporting and down - stream processing .
proposal
houston will use the warehouse as the data source for entelligence and
numerous analytical reporting application systems . these analytical
reporting application systems can include , but are not limited to ,
operational pricing module ( opm ) , enrononline , and daily position report
( dpr ) . once the warehouse is in place , it may be used as the source for
additional downstream systems as well as investor relations reporting .
