subject : fundamental operating standards
all ,
as you may be aware there has been an effort , fostered in houston by beth
apollo , to draft a set of " fundamental operating standards " . the object of
these standards is to set out the best practices of the global counterparty
group for all locations ( houston , calgary , london , southern cone ) .
we are seeking your input to ensure that the standards properly reflect a
london gcp perspective . we - bill hare , james scribner and myself - have
compiled a draft of the standards which is attached below .
it ' s important to note that the standards detail some procedures we have
always carried out , and some that we are working towards . the intention of
setting fundamental operating standards is to agree on and document common
objectives for gcp . with this in mind , we look forward to receiving your
comments on and suggestions for the draft .
if you have any questions please phone me on the numbers below .
regards ,
kathryn
