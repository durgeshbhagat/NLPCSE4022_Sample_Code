Subject: publication schedule for dpr during holiday period
the following schedule has been distributed as noted regarding publishing the
dpr over the next two weeks . i know that books run in calgary , houston , and
portland will be calculated and officialized on friday , december 22 nd for
trading that day . the current plan is not to publish the dpr for december
22 nd on tuesday , december 26 th , but to wait until the first enron official
business day to do so ( i . e . wednesday , december 27 th ) . that will work as
long as trading results for friday , december 22 nd are not dramatic .
please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on friday , december
22 nd for chris abel ( x 33102 ) to give him trading results by commodity for
december 22 nd . if there are dramatic results , chris may produce a
preliminary and rough dpr on tuesday , december 26 th with the information that
you provide . for locations that will not calc and officialize books on
friday , december 22 nd , you will still need to contact chris to give him your
best estimate of trading results .
thanks for your continuing help in providing timely and accurate information
for the worldwide trading organization . i hope that all of you enjoy your
