lexi elliot ,
hi , my name is judd eisenberg , and i am a business student at the
university of texas who is seeking the summer analyst internship at enron .
i received an opportunity to meet you at a reception dinner that enron
hosted last semester in austin . i have always been intrigued with the
analyst and associate rotational programs that enron offers . the courses i
take in school , accounting and particularly finance , my extensive job
experience , and my leadership positions have provided me with valuable
skills for the summer analyst position . i have a good friend at ut who
will start working full - time for enron in the it division in a few months ,
and i know he is truly looking forward to the challenges and opportunities
that enron provides . because i am currently interning with
 in houston , i am not able to go through the
recruiting process at the university . i am sending an attachment of my
resume in this e - mail since i am going to be in houston until mid - march .
please e - mail me if there are any openings for the position i am seeking or
if you have any questions . i look forward to hearing from you soon .
thanks ,
judd eisenberg
