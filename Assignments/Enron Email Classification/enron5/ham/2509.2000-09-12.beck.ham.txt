beth ,
i know you are at the vp level but i thought i would forward you the memo
below .
i wrote it to explain to the enrononline call center the various issues we
have been having with the " bridge " since they get a vast
number of internal calls when we have a problem .
please let me know if you have any questions or if i should be funneling
these concerns to a particular person .
thanks .
jennifer

subject : bridge problems
over the last 8 - 10 business days , we have had a some issues on the bridges . i
want to educate you a little bit on what can cause
" bridge problems " .
first , what i want to explain is their is one gui bridge application for
users ( backoffice users ) to monitor the bridge but there are multiple
systems that enrononline transactions can be pointed to downstream . this is
important to understand because if you do not know this ,
it may seem like we are having the same problem over ie " the bridge
is having problems " . but in actuality , it is different
problems . still not good - but at least it cannot be isolated to one
problem .
also , due to multiple systems ( sitara , enpower , gasdesk , tagg / erms ,
powerdesk ) are listening for messages from one enrononline ,
a " bridge " problem could be one of many issues . some of which are :
the server for enrononline messenger goes down ( doesn ' t send message to
bridge to process )
the enron network goes down ( cannot send message thru bridge )
the nfs server ( enron main server ) goes down
sitara server goes down
enpower server goes down
tagg / erms server goes down
deal worker in any system gets " hung up "
huge volume slows down processing time for one or more downstream systems
scheduled outage for maintenance on server on weekend was not re - started on
sunday
and the list goes on . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
fyi in the past week & 1 / 2 , the following actions happened , which caused
" bridge " problems .
scheduled outage for maintenance on tagg / erms server on weekend was not
re - started on sunday ( not smart )
the nfs server ( enron main server ) goes down ( affected sitara & tagg / erms )
deal worker in sitara system got " hung up " and servers had to be bounced
member of enrononline dev team changed data for specific tokenised periods
during trading hours instead of end of day
( this failed deals in bridge for sitara & tagg / erms )
one thing to remember is you are getting calls from traders & back office .
traders are calling because they cannot see deals in their
position manager application of their system . if they are gas traders , if
could be sitara or tagg system . if they are a power trader
calling , they cannot see it in enpower . ecetera , ecetera
if a back office person calls , they are watching the monitor gui and they can
see deals queing / backing up and know there is a problem .
we are working to resolve some of these issues , particularily ,
multi - processing tools , as we know the # of transactions will only increase .
please feel free to email me if you have any questions . i hope this was
helpful .
see below for explanation of problem on wednesday .

subject : sitara production problem
i am forwarding a message that explains the sitara production problems from
this morning . please let me know if you have any additional questions .
karie ( 36759 )
at 9 : 50 am this morning a dealworker process in the sitara system became
unresponsive .
at 10 : 00 am it was determined that the eolbridge in sitara was not
processing new deal requests
and diagnostics lead to an indication that the dealworker was not functioning
properly .
at 10 : 14 , am the dealworker was forced down and a new one restarted .
at 10 : 21 am , the eolbridge began processing deals .
the cause of the is difficult to determine , but indicators point to an error
in the corba product we are using ,
most likely due to scalability issues of that product and of sitara . this is
an issue that is actively being addressed .
