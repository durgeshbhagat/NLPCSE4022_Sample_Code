Subject: i know we ' ve made good progress with respect to morning reports for egm .
however , i continue to receive most reports after 9 : 00 a . m . , which is too
late into the trading day . please let me know if there are resources you
need , so this aspect of egm can run as smoothly as ena gas .
thanks .
