Subject: re : august monthly status report for mg
i would like to have this same monthly reporting for all offices of the us .
this sort of piggybacks off the discussion we had yesterday on the need for
office information .
do you have someone in your group who would have time to take on this
project ? should this project reside in your group or somewhere else ?
if you could give me your thoughts i ' d appreciate it .

i am working within european financial operations on integrating the mg
companies within the monthly status report for enron offices - please see
attached . the data held so far on this document has been obtained from our
records but may contain inaccuracies / ommissions due to the disparate nature
of information .
in order to obtain an update on the progress made with the integration of the
north american trading and the americas origination companies i was hoping
that you , or someone within your department , could add a short paragraph
summarising the status of work taking place on each of the above companies
and ensure that the details as noted are correct .
many thanks for your assistance .
best regards
