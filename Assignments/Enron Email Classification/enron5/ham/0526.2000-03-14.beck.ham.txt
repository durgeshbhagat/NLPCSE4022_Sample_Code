subject : killed trades
it has come to light that there have been a number of enrononline
transactions which have been " undone " after the fact .
these are situations in which an enrononline trade has been completed , but we
have agreed verbally with the other party that the trade will be deemed not
have happened and we may have suppressed generation of a faxed confirmation .
it is of great importance that we do not do anything which makes an
enrononline trade appear as though it is not firm , or not reliable , or which
affects the audit process .
therefore , enrononline transactions must not be killed .
individual traders might elect to conduct an otc transaction which has the
effect of reversing the impact of an enrononline transaction - this activity
is outside the scope of enrononline .
please note that there has never been an instance in which there has been a
system error on enrononline which caused a trade to take place which was not
initiated by the customer . all instances to date have involved some kind of
operator error , or failure to use the results of a transaction search to
verify completed deals .
