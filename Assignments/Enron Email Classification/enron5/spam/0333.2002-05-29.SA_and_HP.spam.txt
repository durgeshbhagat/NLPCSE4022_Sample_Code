Subject: adv : put your resume back to work
dear candidate ,
we recently came across a posting of your resume on the internet . after our
research , we determined that it was not posted on over 45 other top job sites .
the impact to you is that over 83 % of the employers and recruiters looking to
hire candidates with your skills are not reading your resume .
is your resume taking the day off ?
while most people post their resumes on the top three job sites , such as monster ,
hotjobs , and careerbuilder , there are many other specialized job sites that employers
and recruiters use to find candidates .
when those specialized job sites are combined with the top three job sites , your
resume is read by nearly 100 % of the employers and recruiters who are looking
to hire or place candidates with your skills .
