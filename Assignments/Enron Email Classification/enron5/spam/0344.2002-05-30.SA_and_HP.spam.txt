oconnor
quickly moved his cursor down the left side of the web page . then ,
showing a flash of his silky skills , he cut across to the right
hand side and clicked on top ten special offers .
he zipped past the irish chicken breast fillets at 25 % off , nipped
round the hb selections ice cream also at 25 % off and went on
with the goal firmly in sight .
with
one of his trademark clicks of the mouse he sent his cost - price
cases of beer straight into the back of his online basket . 1
0 to ireland . from there oconnor was unstoppable and went
on to make it an unforgettable afternoon as he tucked away another
four goals .
