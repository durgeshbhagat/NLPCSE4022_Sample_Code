microcap
marketing playof the week . our trademark is our
uncanny ability to spot stocks that have bottomed - out and anticipate their
rebound and upward trend . most of the stocks we track rebound and
peak within just two days , giving investors opportunity to make a few
bucks back in such a highly volatile market . we don ' t believe the
market is such as to take any long - term positions right now . but in
a highly unstable marketplace , the opportunities for short - term stabs
( gains ) are abundant . when the question today seems to be which way
is up , we like to think that from the bottom there is no other way - - - it ' s
all a matter of
timing .
