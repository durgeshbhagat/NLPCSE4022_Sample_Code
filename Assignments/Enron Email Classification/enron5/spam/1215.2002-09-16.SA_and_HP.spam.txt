lodged into a security company here in the country by the
late head of state ( gen . sani abacha ) for safe - keeping . this
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does
not know the true content of the boxes . this money was
originally meant to be used for his political campaign .
because i was his family attorney as such he confided in me
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit
before he died of cardiac arrest .

an offshore security company to move this money as a
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim
