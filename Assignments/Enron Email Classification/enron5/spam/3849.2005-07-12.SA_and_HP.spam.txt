Subject: peace unto you
dear sir / madam ,
we are rev thomas & racael david , we print christian books and export to europe / america . we are searching for a christain representative who can help us establish a medium of getting to our costumers in america / canada as well as recieving payments due to our ministry . our clients find it difficult to release payments to us because they find it difficult to make wire transfer or we have no representative closer to recieve checks from . but with you around , they can easily send the funds to you if we tell them that you are our christain brother / sister .
if you are interested in representing our ministry , we will be very glad as you shall be entitled to 5 % of every total amount you recieve for us . directives would be given to you on how to send the funds across to us .
please contact us for more information . subject to your satisfaction you will be given the opportunity to negotiate the mode of which we will pay for your services as our representative in america . there is no more responsibility than this like travelling to meet them or spending money from your pocket .
i hereby request you forward any proof of your identities , your current telephone and fax numbers including your forwarding address to establish trust and business relationship and also to enable us inform our clients to communicate with you .
thanks ,
remain blessed
rev thomas & rachael david
