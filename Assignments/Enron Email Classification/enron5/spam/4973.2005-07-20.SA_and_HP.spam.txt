synopsis chikhloo , a twelve - year - old orphan stays in village mangalpada
with his grandmother . his fellow villagers thought they could rag him since he
was just a small , helpless orphan . in order to counter their vile intentions , chikhloo was
forced to resort to defense tactics . he soon learnt that offense is the best
form of defense . he also realized that he possesses an inborn talent for
mischief , and soon , what had begun as a mere means of survival , turned into
divine enjoyment for chikhloo . now he thrives on causing tremendous angst to
the villagers , and they have become his sworn enemies . alas ,
chikhloo is only half of the villagersõ worries . their other nemesis is bhutya ,
the dreaded ghost that haunts the jungles surrounding the village . in
mangalpada , every adversityé be it epidemic , accident , or deathé is attributed
to be bhutyaõs doing . they even deem chikhloo to be an incarnate of bhutya
himself . ?why not ? ó thinks chikhloo . if he joined forces with bhutya ,
he would have an upper hand in his war against the villagers . and chikhloo sets
off into the jungles to meet bhutya . chikhloo meets bhutya and finds him to be not so scary after
all . citing the villagers to be their common enemy , he lays before the ghost of
the jungle , a profound proposal of partnership . awed and amused by the boyõs
gall , bhutya agrees to be chikhlooõs friend and to help him teach the villagers
a lesson they would never forget . what follows is a heart - warming narrative of
