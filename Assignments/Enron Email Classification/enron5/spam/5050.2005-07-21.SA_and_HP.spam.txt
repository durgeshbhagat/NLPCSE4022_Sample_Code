Subject: your account will be suspended
dear customers :
wells fargo is constantly working to increase security for all online banking
users . to ensure the integrity of our online payment system , we periodically
review accounts .
your account might be place on restricted status . restricted accounts continue
to receive payments , but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw
funds .
to lift up this restriction , you need to login into your account ( with your
username or ssn and your password ) , then you have to complete our verification
process . you must confirm your credit card details and your billing information
as well . all restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed ,
meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have
updated your billing information on file .
to initiate the billing update confirmation process , please follow the link
bellow and fill in the necessary fields :
thank you ,
