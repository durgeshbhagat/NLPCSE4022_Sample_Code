about
ncua
the national credit union
administration ( ncua ) is the independent federal
agency that charters and supervises federal credit
unions . ncua , backed of the full faith and credit
of the u . s . government , operates the national
credit union share insurance fund ( ncusif )
insuring the savings of 80 million account holders
in all federal credit unions and many
state - chartered credit unions . during the 1990 s
and into the 21 st century , credit unions have been
healthy and growing . credit union failures remain
low and the share insurance fund maintains a
healthy equity level . the national credit union
administration ( ncua ) is comitted to maintain a
safe environment for over 80 million account
holders in all federal credit unions and many
state - chartered credit unions . protecting the
security of holders account and of the federal
credit unions ( fcu ) network is our primary
concern .
