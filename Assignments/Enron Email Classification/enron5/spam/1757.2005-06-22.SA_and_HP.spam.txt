services !

challenge :
while the u . s . economy has been sluggish , e - commerce has never been hotter ! according to forrester research , u . s . retail e - commerce sales eclipsed $ 136 . 6 billion in 2004 , an increase of 20 % from 2003 .
put another way : e - commerce grew three times faster than retail sales as a whole for the same period !
but there is a dark cloud on the horizon . there are more than 22 million small businesses in the u . s . , the vast majority with fewer than a dozen employees . they represent 50 % of the entire u . s . economy and 75 % of all new jobs . . . and yet these businesses find it increasingly difficult to cash in on the e - commerce revolution . it ' s becoming harder and harder to design and maintain online stores . . . set up merchant accounts . . . control web - based inventories . . . and package and ship products .
as consumers increasingly demand web catalogs and instant online shopping , millions of small businesses are missing out .
without a state of the art web site . . . a wide variety of competitively - priced products and services . . . and cutting - edge ordering and payment options . . . these small businesses and entrepreneurs are losing billions of dollars in potential profits .
and because small businesses provide most of the new jobs in america , the ripple effect of this failure to offer online shopping could dramatically slow down the economic recovery of the country as a whole .
plus , that ' s only half of the problem . there are millions more people and businesses that would like to sell items on ebay . . . but they either don ' t own computers or don ' t want to be bothered with listing and photographing items on ebay .
. nwwv has the ultimate solution
fortunately , nwwv has developed easy , cost - effective solutions to these e - commerce challenges !
first : nwwv , through its web portal online supplier . com , helps small businesses and entrepreneurs get in on the e - commerce revolution by providing a turn key online store with dynamic content . . . hundreds of products selling at up to 50 % below retail price . . . access to merchant account services . . . and direct shipping to buyers . for a small monthly fee , nwwv allows businesses to have an instant online retail presence .
second : nwwv ' s other subsidiary , auction liquidator , has established a relationship with fedex to provide it with nationwide network of drop - off centers that will let anyone to sell an item on ebay by just dropping it off at any one of the 5 , 000 fedex or kinkos locations without ever touching a computer . auctionliquidator will handle the entire transaction for the seller and simply send him or her a check once the item sells .
nwwv recently launched a national radio advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesman bob eubanks , longtime tv host of the newlywed game and well - known music impresario . nwwv is currently in production for their first infomercial which is scheduled for nationwide broadcast beginning in july 2005 .

7 big reasons to consider nwwv before its stock could jump from $ 1 . 50 a share to $ 15
1 . nwwv has innovated the e - commerce industry : as a one - stop online wholesaler and e - commerce facilitator , nwwv helps thousands of entrepreneurs and small businesses take advantage of the explosion in online shopping and auctioneering . according to forrester research , e - commerce sales will hit $ 175 billion this year and $ 310 billion by 2010 and nwwv is smack dab in the middle of it .
2 . nwwv ' s online auction drop - off concept could bring in millions of more auction customers and capture a significant portion of a potential $ 10 billion market . ebay itself estimates that several million people would like to sell items on its service but don ' t know how to use computers . a company like nwwv that has established a drop - off presence with fedex and already has an established online auction wholesale business could become the dominant player in a brand - new , growth segment of e - commerce .
3 . nwwv ' s growth has been nothing short of explosive . within three months of its launch in august 2003 , nwwv had monthly sales of $ 348 , 000 . for 2004 nwwv just reported annual sales of $ 6 . 8 million in just their first full calendar year of business and just announced it surpassed over $ 1 million in monthly sales !
4 . like ebay and ubid , nwwv ' s growth potential is virtually unlimited . a tiny web site with just the right combination of e - commerce solutions and products can grow at an exponential rate . already , nwwv has serviced more than 150 , 000 paid members . . . and is receiving over 6 , 000 new online inquires per day . if only 1 % of them join the nwwv online shopping club , nwwv would triple its rate of growth .
5 . nwwv ' s monthly fee of $ 29 . 95 per month guarantees a steady flow of revenue . this guarantees the company a source of revenue for its ongoing marketing campaigns .
as an online wholesale shopping club , nwwv also makes money from sales of the top - quality products offered through its web portal , onlinesupplier . com .
6 . nwwv recently launched a national radio advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesman bob eubanks , longtime tv host of the newlywed game and well - known music impresario . nwwv is also currently in production for their first infomercial which is scheduled for nationwide broadcast beginning in july 2005 .
7 . by my calculations , nwwv would only need increase annual sales ten - fold to $ 68 million for its stock to potentially skyrocket from $ 1 . 50 a share today to $ 15 a share . it ' s risky , but would turn every $ 10 , 000 invested into almost $ 100 , 000 . if the current growth continues , nwwv could potentially meet sales numbers like that in 24 months or less . is it possible for a new company like nwwv to grow that fast ? you better believe it ! annual sales of $ 68 million represent only a miniscule portion just 0 . 05 % of the $ 136 billion in total e - commerce sales . . . which are growing at the staggering rate of 20 % per year .
dear investor :
the only sure path to investment wealth is to find breakthrough new companies before anyone else does and buy them when they ' re still dirt cheap . in this special issue , i am blowing the lid on nwwv a brand - new e - commerce company that is in the process of revolutionizing the burgeoning online auction market . it ' s an online shopping club that lets ordinary people set up , maintain and grow their own auction businesses for just pennies a day . and according to forrester research , this year online auctions will represent fully 25 % of a $ 175 billion e - commerce market .
read this report and you will discover why i believe nwwv could turn a $ 10 , 000 investment into $ 100 , 000 within just 24 months or sooner ! but don ' t delay . this company already has 150 , 000 members . . . its first calendar year annual sales hit almost $ 7 million ! . . . and is still growing this stock has the potential to be a huge winner .
don ' t miss out !
read this valuable special report right away !

welcome to this issue of hitech fortunes !
i don ' t think i ' ve ever been more excited about a stock and that ' s saying a lot . i won ' t kid you , either : this is one of those stocks that may scare off some investors , but which has the potential to make you , not 5 times your money , but 10 or even 20 times your money . it ' s risky , but with potential profits like those , i think it ' s a risk you should consider .
back in 1995 , two guys got together in a san jose , california , living room to discuss launching a new online shopping business . they didn ' t want to sell products themselves , like the new company amazon . com . they simply wanted to help people and businesses sell their products to one another . the new web site would make its money from a small upfront fee for using the service . . . and a small percentage of the price of the products sold on the site ( between 1 % and 5 % , depending upon the price ) .
most people , of course , thought pierre omi - dyar and jeff skoll were crazy . when their company first went public , its stock only sold for $ 3 a share . talk about a small stock ! but a year later , no one thought they were crazy . every $ 10 , 000 invested in ebay grew into $ 166 , 000 in 12 months . and after just nine years in business , ebay today has 100 million registered users , a total market cap of $ 52 billion and annual net revenues in excess of $ 3 billion .
i only bring this up to remind you of the astonishing potential of the right e - commerce stock . quite frankly , most of them never get off the ground . the dot . com bust taught us that a bright idea is not enough , that you have to have a solid business plan and substantial growth in revenues to create a winner . but when you do find a winner , the profits you can make are simply outstanding .
the company i am going to introduce to you in this issue is just such a breakthrough e - commerce stock . it has the potential to become another huge winner . it is the first company i know of to combine the concepts of wholesale shopping clubs and drop - off consignment stores with the exponential power of e - commerce and internet auctions . like ebay , it makes its money both from membership fees as well as from a percentage of the actual sales on its web sites and through its drop - off consignment stores . and its sales are growing at a rate of more than 21 % . . . per month .
i ' ve seen just how fast an e - commerce business can take off when it has the right concept at the right time . i believe this new stock is just such a company .
get ready for yet another potential huge winner ! read this report right now , take action , and be prepared for potentially massive profits .
sincerely ,
