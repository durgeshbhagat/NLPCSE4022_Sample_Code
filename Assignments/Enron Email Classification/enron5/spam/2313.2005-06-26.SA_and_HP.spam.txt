the illiterate of the 21 st century will not be those who cannot read and write , but those who cannot learn , unlearn , and relearn . alvin toffler . the parent arrived back on the scene . she gave me a tape by dr . laura meyers from ucla . i listened to that tape eight times . i listened over and over and heard the same thing again and again . ms . meyers said , ' these kids may need to hear a word many times ( perhaps 72 times ) before they ever say a word . a computer can be patient and say it the same way every time . ' now i understood . i was not patient enough . i did not allow the student to hear the words over and over . i was interrupting their learning by interjecting , when they were totally engrossed in what they were doing . i was asking questions they were not ready to answer . they were just learning language . they didn ' t have the answers yet . .
