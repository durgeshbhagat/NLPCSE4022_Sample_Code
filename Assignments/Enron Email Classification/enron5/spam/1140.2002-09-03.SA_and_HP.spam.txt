client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a security company abroad . this fund
came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client ' s portfolio during his tenure

from the vaults of the central bank of nigeria to this security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal security outfit of the then president . but before the purchase could take place the president died . my client has deceided to keep this for himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime . but due to his incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the
