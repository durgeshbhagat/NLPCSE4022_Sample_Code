humane / cordial request for assistance
dear friend ,
i am bar . stephen kwesi , a practising lawyer as well as a human right activist here in ghana .
i am contacting you based on a discussion i had with one miss mary fati whom i happen to meet in the refugee camp in one of my reutine visitations to the refugee camps .
the little mary ( 24 ) is originally from the war engulfed area of darfur ? sudan .
she lost her parents and sibblings in the cost of the war and she is all alone now but she was fortunate to find a safe in her father ? s private room and this safe contains a total sum of sixteen million , five hundred thousand united states dollars only ( us $ 16 , 500 , 000 . 00 ) .
this safe was successfully deposited with a private security company here in ghana as family belongings , which i have confirmed with the company as she has handed over all the relevant documents of this deposit to me .
i have confirmed her needs and they include , helping her receive her fund in a secured account , helping her arrange a travelling document out of ghana , assisting her in a way to complete her education and finally and most importantly guiding her in investment purposes with this fund .
my dear , i have little knowledge about your ability and would want you to work with me in helping this little girl whose situation is quit pitiable . you will be compensated appropriately . i will link you up to her if you wish to otherwise we could discuss on possible ways of finalising this transaction .
you can reach me directly on the above telephone number or email or you can reach little mary via her email address ; maryfati @ myway . com
regards ,
bar . stephen kwesi
