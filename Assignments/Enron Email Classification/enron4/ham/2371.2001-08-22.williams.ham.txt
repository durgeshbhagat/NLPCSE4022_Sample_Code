Subject: arco outage on thursday , 8 / 23
real - timers :
arco is going down for a few hours in the morning on thursday , 8 / 23 to conduct some maintenance . they are prescheduled at 26 mw , but from he 2 - 9 , they will only be able to produce 10 mw . so , please reduce their generation schedule , and purchase 16 mw , he 2 - 9 , in spl 5 for them .
also , for he 3 - 6 , of those 16 mw that you purchase for arco , please sell 11 mw to st west services ( deal # 744709 ) , and then sell to arco ( deal # 744714 ) for the same price that you sold to west services . the remainder just sell straight to arco . this needs to be done because there were some funky schedule adjustments by the iso . basically , the iso cut arco ' s day - ahead schedule by 11 mw for he 3 - 6 , so west services had wear that in order for the day - ahead enpower to caps report to tie out .
one more thing , the iso also adjusted several other generator schedules for he 3 - 6 , on thursday , 8 / 23 . i emailed the generators who were affected ( sierra , wheelabrator martel , and nove ) . i told them that we resubmitted all their schedules in the hour ahead market , and that we were relatively confident that their preferred schedules would be awarded hour ahead . but if they so desired , they could call into the real - time desk one hour before the flow to check the hour - ahead final . that way the could make any adjustments to their generation if necessary . so , you might get a few calls in the middle of the night from a few generators to check their final hour - ahead schedules . but to be honest , i highly doubt you ' ll get any calls . i know you won ' t get a call from nove or sierra , if you do get a call it might be from wheelabrator martel .
thanks a bunch ,
