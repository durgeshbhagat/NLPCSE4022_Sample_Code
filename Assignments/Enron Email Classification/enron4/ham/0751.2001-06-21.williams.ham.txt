bill ,
we ' re trying to get a call in to ferc . i am comfortable telling you to use the ferc ' s higher number until directed otherwise by ferc but i give relatively good odds that ferc will cave on this . i am not a lawyer , but when they cave , i doubt they can do it retroactively .
steve hall , any thoughts ?

alan ,
i just received this from our client rep detailing their position .
as expected they are treating the stage 1 as ending at 11 : 32 rather than he 23 as stated on may 31 in both their website and on their message net .
i would like to get ferc ' s position on this if necessary . if it is $ 91 . 87 rather than $ 108 . 49 as indicated in the ferc order , we will use that as a cap as soon as ferc ( or you ) recommends it .
thanks ,
bill

bill , the $ 108 . 08 price you see in footnote # 3 of the e - mail titled caiso
notice : correction of ferc june 19 order market notice is the highest hourly
ex - post price during the last stage 1 . the $ 91 . 87 price is 85 % of $ 108 . 08
per the ferc order .
the last stage 1 occurred on trade date 5 / 31 / 01 , he 10 and 11 . a stage 2
was in effect from 1132 - 2215 . see
http : / / www . caiso . com / docs / 09003 a 6080 / 08 / 8 a / 09003 a 6080088 aa 7 . xls , 2001
emergency detail tab .
the hourly ex post price can be found in oasis under button 29 , ex post
market information on the caiso website . the order indicates that the price
should not include a stage 2 and 3 and even though the cancellation notice
of the stage lwas not until he 23 we are going by the strict definition of
when the stage 1 was actually implemented . hope this helps .
