subject : busy day with the la times
investigative reporters at the la times called me today ( i ' m not going
to say who , but they are long - time pros , don ' t worry about that ) asking
questions about the enormous amount of out of market ( oom ) energy being
purchased by the iso . they wanted to know if this was due to the
dwr / cers long - term contracts ? they wanted to know if this is effecting
the real - time markets .
the answers , of course , is yes . however , i need you folks to help me
collect information from your settlements people substantiating what is
currently conjecture . that is , the oom costs are being allocated to
scehduling coordinators who are " short " in their hourly schedules . your
generators may be buying real - time energy from the iso , thinking they
are getting a bargain , only to discover 60 days later , or more , that an
enormous oom charge has been allocated to your company . that is highway
robbery . help me put some evidence to this .
