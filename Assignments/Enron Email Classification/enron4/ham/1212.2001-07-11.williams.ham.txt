Subject: iso compliance filing on june 19 ferc order
all ,
i have reviewed documents from the iso ' s website regarding forced outages as they relate to the june 19 ferc order and concluded the following :
( 1 ) during a system emergency , a penalty based on twice the highest price paid for energy in the hour could be assessed if the participating generator does not notify the iso of the outage within the operating hour of the outage , and
( 2 ) during a non - system emergency , a generator could be assessed a penalty if it fails to report the forced outage within the operating hour .
if you have any questions at all , i can be reached at extension 7733 .
thanks ,
donna
