greg ,
my brother is looking to make a career change from teaching ( currently a biology teacher at richland high school ) into something where performance is rewarded .
he is an extremely hard worker who is ultra competitive . do you have any needs for entry level hourly guys ? i think he could learn the business quick and do well in our industry .
i know there is a ton of market uncertainty in the west right now with the california debacle , so i ' m not sure if you need people or not . let me know if there is any chance for an interview and i can have my brother send a resume .
hope everything is going well for you and your family .
thanks .
