after speaking with risk and recognizing many inconsistencies in the way that the following deals were done , i have made the following changes that will affect your books :
there will be no deals on the st w hourly books .
st nw will show only pge purchase deal # 529161 . 1 ( offset by swap between st nw and lt nw ) .
all other deals ( 421598 . 1 , 530654 . 1 , 530653 . 1 , 530690 . 1 , 530716 . 1 , and 530689 . 1 ) have been changed to the lt nw book .
i hope this will make things easier .

august 29 , 2001 : virginia set deal # 421598 . 1 back to 7 mw , keeping sale to lp whole , and entered deal # 754187 . 1 to buy back 3 mw of lp energy at 70 % of the price sold real time . ( 70 % / 30 % split according to agreement with lp ) .
vt routed original purchase from pge - deal 529161 . 1 ( st nw ) back to lousiana pacific - deal # 421598 . 1 ( lt nw ) and routed the " buy - back " deal # 754187 . 1 ( st w hourly ) to wwp and to puget ( st w hourly ) .
