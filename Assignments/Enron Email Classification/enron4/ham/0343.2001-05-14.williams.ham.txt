Subject: daily ees position 5 / 15
daniel & judy -
please note - i have adjusted 5 / 1 to reflect the load ees reported to epmi for that day . i just received your sheet from michael ( spruiell ) today , and didn ' t have a chance to go over the revised spreadsheet with phil ( platter ) before he left . this may need some more tweaking , but please let me know if we ' re getting closer to solving the mystery of may lst .
thanks ,
kate
