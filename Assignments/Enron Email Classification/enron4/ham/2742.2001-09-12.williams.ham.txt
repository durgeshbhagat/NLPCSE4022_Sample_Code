Subject: problems w / enpower
if you are trying to make changes to any deals today you may have some trouble saving your changes . if you get a prompt saying you can ' t save this deal b / c of missing legal entity data . do the following
1 . go to the risk tabl
2 . the second white entry portion ( from the bottom ) will allow you to enter primary legal entity
3 . in this section type in the counterparty ( example allegheny , epmi short term southwest , epmi long term california , whoever you are doing business with )
if you have any problems let me know . thanks .
p . s . this should be fixed tomorrow .
