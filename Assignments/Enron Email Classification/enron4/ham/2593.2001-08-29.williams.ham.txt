subject : august hourly bloomberg deals still not cleared
please find attached an excel spreadsheet of bloomberg deals i can ' t seem to match up with our deals in enpower . this is for august 1 through august 22 . none of these deals have bloomberg as the broker in enpower . i was told in june to allow a two day grace period before the deals should be in enpower and that did not occur .
please let me know if there is anything i can do to help resolve these problems .
