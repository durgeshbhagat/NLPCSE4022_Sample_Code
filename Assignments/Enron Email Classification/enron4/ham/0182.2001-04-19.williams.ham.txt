fyi - attached is a complaint filed by care on april 16 against bc hydro , powerex , mirant and bpa ( with the ladwp thrown in as an unnamed respondent ) . the complaint is principally directed against bc hydro and powerex . it essentially accuses bc hydro and powerex of manipulating the reservoirs in bc and transmission capacity reserved by powerex on the bpa system to cob and nob to withhold power during a period of peak demand " to contrive a shortage and test their market power . " care accuses bc hydro and powerex of violating section 206 of the fpa , state and federal anti - trust laws , the civil rights of californians under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 and nafta .
the complaint is long on sensational allegations and short on facts . the evidence proffered in the complaint consists of a rant off the yahoo message board by an unnamed power trader in spokane ( we think it is an avista trader ) , selected transmission data from the iso , the la times article of april 11 , 2001 regarding the iso ' s report on powerex , bpa and ladwp , the iso report itself , and bc hydro ' s residential rate schedule . care requests ferc to initiate an investigation , seeks unspecified refunds and punitive damages and also appears to want ferc to have the secretary of doe declare an emergency under section 202 ( c ) of the fpa and compel deliveries of electricity .
ferc has noticed the complaint and has established may 8 as the due date for interventions and responses .
