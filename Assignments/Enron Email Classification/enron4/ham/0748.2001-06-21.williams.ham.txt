Subject: cell phones
hey bill ,
eric linder and craig dean have requested for me to order new cell phones for them .
i told them i would have to run it by you first . craig is actually in dire need of a
new phone , his phone doesn ' t even ring . it ' s pretty damaged . i will wait until
i here further more from you to order these .
in the future is there a procedure you would like me to go through to order new cell phones
for these guys ?
thanks , jill
