i have obtained a copy of a letter from representative tauzin and others to ferc chairman hebert which appears below . it could provide some indication of the direction ferc will take with the order it plans to issue next monday . summarizing , the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire wscc , which plan should :
prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements ; refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan
adopt market mechanisms ( rather than imposing rigid price controls ) and allow recovery of all verifiable costs
promote conservation and demand response

federal energy regulatory commission

dear chairman h ? bert :
since last summer , the committee on energy and commerce has closely
monitored the electricity situation in california . today , the west
continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century , and
california faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again
this summer . after extensive review of the energy crisis in the west ,
including several hearings in washington and california , we recommend that
the commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity
prices and keep power flowing into california .
we recognize the commission ' s efforts in recent months to address the
electricity crisis in the california and western markets , including measures
to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices . while we are
pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout
the west , we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale
electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in california and the
entire west in the hot summer months to come . to ensure that prices are
just and reasonable during the critical months ahead , we believe the
commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices
in western markets . we strongly urge the commission to implement a
comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor
wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market
participants within the entire western systems coordinating council ( wscc ) .
specifically , such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale
electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the
wscc . the plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and
failures to comply with agreements to sell power . if the commission finds
that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan , it
should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the
full extent allowed by law .
aware of the danger of discouraging supply , the commission has relied upon
market - oriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would
exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts . we share
the commission ' s concerns regarding the need to encourage supply .
accordingly , to prevent blackouts and contribute to a long - term solution ,
the commission ' s comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as
appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging
availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission .
to mitigate prices and increase available supply , we also urge the
commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote
conservation and demand response throughout the western market . in states
where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs , consumers have less
incentive to conserve . while demand reduction incentives are not a
substitute for accurate price signals , a demand response program can
encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity .
such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both
wholesale and retail consumers to sell , at market or other incentive prices ,
" foregone " electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume .
specifically , the commission should : ( 1 ) establish or certify a wholesale
" clearinghouse " for demand reduction agreements ; and ( 2 ) enable consumers ,
whether individually or through aggregation arrangements , to sell foregone
power to their own local distribution utility or to third - party purchasers .
we recognize that individual states and utilities are implementing demand
reduction programs , but a broader , regional solution is needed to enable
sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer . we
understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting state
laws , abrogating existing contracts , or shifting costs to non - participant
consumers .
we look forward to working with you to build upon the commission ' s previous
efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for
consumers in california and the west this summer and thereafter . to ensure
maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead , we request that you
take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as
possible . we request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not
later than the close of business on friday , june 22 . if you have questions
please contact our staff . thank you in advance for your cooperation with
this request .
sincerely ,
