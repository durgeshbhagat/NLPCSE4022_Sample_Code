to all -
i just received a call from thresa allen in houston regarding a louisiana - pacific sale made by long term northwest . the deal flows 2000 through 2006 , and the dispute falls on 2 / 23 and 2 / 24 of this year . the 7 mw round - the - clock sale was reduced to 4 mw for he 11 - 24 on 2 / 23 and he 1 - 24 on 2 / 24 . louisiana is disputing this , saying we should have booked out with them for these hours . ( diana entered deals to bookout with louisiana for 2 / 25 - 2 / 28 - 530268 , 530334 , 531224 , 531549 , 532573 . ) thresa believes we need to enter a 3 mw purchase to complete the bookout for 2 / 23 - 2 / 24 .
i wanted to check with you guys before doing anything because your names are the three on the deal numbers she gave me . ( bill entered a purchase annuity from l - pac - 531549 - for a ramp down . )
please let me know if any of this sounds familiar . thresa said this dispute was filed back in june , so she ' s eager to get it resolved .
thanks for your help ,
