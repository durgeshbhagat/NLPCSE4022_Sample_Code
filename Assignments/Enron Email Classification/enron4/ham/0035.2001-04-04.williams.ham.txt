Subject: re : weights ? nice .
i completely forgot about your trip to vegas . i bet you didn ' t ! ha ha . anyhow , i ' m bummed that you are going to gone thursday and we won ' t be able to hang out at the happy hour . you ' ll be having a blast in vegas though , so no biggie . anyhow , i guess i ' ll see you tomorrow . maybe we can go get a beer after work tomorrow night if you don ' t leave too early . if not , there will be much beer to drink when you get back into town next week .
bye
