Subject: midc schedule going real - time 6 / 20 / 01
there is a 25 mw heavy load schedule that bpa is generating ( contract # 23299 ) and pge sinks at system . the schedule is going real - time because bpa transmission group did not build the proper account for this path . we bought from bpa deal # 308337 . 1 and sold to epme deal # 489735 . 1 . please refer to epme tag number # 10416 . i spoke with matt at bpa power side who agreed this was a good schedule . be sure to call everyone in the path to check out .
thanks ,
stacy
