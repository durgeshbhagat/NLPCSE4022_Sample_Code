dear grace ,
i hope your summer is giving you some opportunities to enjoy nice weather .
we ' ve had an interesting inquiry from a national business publication ;
they ' re looking for stories about people who ' ve been through our negotiation
courses who feel the course played a significant role in their professional
- - or personal lives .
can you think of anyone from enron / portland who might be interested in being
interviewed ?
please give my regards to the ' gang ' . i look forward to working with you
again .
cordially ,
steve
