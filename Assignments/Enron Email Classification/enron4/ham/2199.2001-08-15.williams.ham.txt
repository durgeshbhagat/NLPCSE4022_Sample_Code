Subject: dispute research protocol - for your review
virginia & mike -
in your ( sadly noted ) absence today , i decided to put together a brief document to help facilitate the dispute research process and its relation to the real time group . i know this is information of which you ' re well aware , but i thought it would be useful to have it documented for our convenience as well as for future generations of volume management experts .
please let me know what you think - if all relevant information is included and whether or not it ' s conveyed clearly .
thanks ,
kate
