we have a fantastic opportunity for employees of our sponsors and suite
holder companies . due to last minute scheduling conflicts , a large
block of our volunteers for the party at pge park this coming friday had
to cancel . this has obviously created some last minute challenges for
pge park , but it is a great opportunity for your employees to volunteer
a few hours of their time on behalf of some great causes plus see the
four tops and the spinners in concert for free . here ' s how :
party at pge park is a fundraiser for the portland oregon sports
authority , solv , and special olympics oregon .
we are about 40 volunteers short to assist with serving the vip dinner .
volunteers would work from 4 : 00 p . m . to 9 : 00 p . m . on assisting with the
pre - concert food service .
in exchage , each volunteer will get two free tickets to that evenings '
concert plus a voucher for a free hot dog , chips , and soda .
this opportunity is open to your employees and spouses , significant
others , or other adult family members . we ' re sorry , but children cannot
volunteer for this particular opportunity .
