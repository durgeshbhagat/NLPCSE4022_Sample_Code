group ,
delano is back from a unit outage , and all day ( monday , 8 / 20 ) we have been selling 25 mw for them . bert has already sold them through he 22 . guys on the night shift , please sell only 10 mw for he 23 - 24 . they will produce a total of 45 mw through he 22 , then drop to 30 mw he 23 - 24 . they were prescheduled at 20 mw all day long . they are back to their normal preschedule for tuesday , 8 / 21 ( 45 mw peak , and 30 mw off - peak ) , so no real - time action is required for tuesday .
thanks for your help .
