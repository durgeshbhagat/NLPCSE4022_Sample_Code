Subject: caiso notification : demand relief program settlement charge types
this is a reminder that the summer 2001 iso demand relief program
charges are reflected on the june 30 statements and june invoices . as
announced previously this year , the iso has developed a summer 2001 demand
relief program ( drp ) . the program is designed to provide an additional
level of demand reduction on the iso system that can be implemented during a
stage 2 emergency in an effort to prevent involuntary load curtailments or
rotating blackouts associated with a stage 3 emergency .
similar to last years program , the same charge types are utilized
for capacity , charge type 7 and 117 , described in the first link below . two
new charge types , 3472 and 3482 , have been created for the energy payment
and allocation when contracted loads are called upon to curtail , described
in the second link below . although the program was initiated in june , no
calls were made to curtail load , therefore , charges 3472 and 3482 were not
utilized . the periods in which the demand relief program was called upon
to initiate interruptions of contracted loads can be found at the third link
below .
