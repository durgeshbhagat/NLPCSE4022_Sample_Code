billy ,
i just wanted to thank you for your making the time to meet with me on tuesday afternoon . i appreciated your time and felt it gave me some useful information regarding the analyst program . i believe the better understanding of the program that you provided will allow me to better manage and coordinate the activities of the analysts in the real - time group in portland . i do think a visit and information session later in the summer might be helpful as well .
thank you again for your time and enjoy the holiday weekend .
