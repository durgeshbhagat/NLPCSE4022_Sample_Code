Subject: colstrip cut for 09 / 06 / 01
to whom it may concern ,
just wanted to let you know that colstrip units 1 thru 4 tripped off line @ approximately 2 : 45 . the integrated number that pge gave me was a 19 mw , so i purchased a tranny wheel for 13 mw from bpa ( portland general to mpc ) . furthermore , for he 04 thru he 07 the schedules went to zero and i resupplied from pge and bought a tranny wheel from bpa ( same as above ) . the new deals in enpower are 764045 , 764203 , and 764168 . if you have any questions i have put a cut note by kate symes in the accordian file and put cut notes in lotus under the respective counter parties ( expresspip , holnam , luzenac , louisiana pacific , and ashgrove ) . if there are any questions please give me a call .
