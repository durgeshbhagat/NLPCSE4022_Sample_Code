chris ,
i agree with bill ' s assessment as shown in the attachment . prior to submitting bids , vol mgmt needs to know the agreed upon shared savings between epmi and the specific customers so we can set up our tools to capture these correctly . please stop by to discuss .
thanks ,
kourtney

chris ,
i attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding . from a real - time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately . i believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well . kourtney nelson is out of the office today but will return on monday . i feel we should involve her in the process when she returns . overall , this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement . feel free to see me with questions .
thanks ,
bill
