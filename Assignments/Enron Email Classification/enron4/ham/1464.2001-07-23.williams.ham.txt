Subject: timekeeping
bill ,
i just wanted to let you know that it ' s going to take a couple weeks ( i think ) until i receive access to the timekeeping system . apparently after requesting access , isc sends back a ticket number and an fyi ( below ) .
as soon as i receive access i will go back for your group and enter their time , and from then on keep track of the groups time for each month .
thanks , jill
