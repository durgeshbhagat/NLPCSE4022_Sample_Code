Subject: fw : can you check a deal for me
bill ,
this email and the next email i am forwarding to you are in regards to follow - up on the pma deal # 549162 . 1 that was zero ' d out at he 3 because neither side of the deal shows it . it definitely looks like a service deal because of the price . so i have asked sandy at mpc to check once more . i have also emailed all houston settlements coordinators to check for counterparty disputes on that day so we can see if this purchase and sale belong to anyone else .
