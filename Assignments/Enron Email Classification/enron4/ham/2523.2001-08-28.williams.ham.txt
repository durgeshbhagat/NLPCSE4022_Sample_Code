Subject: fall season and schedule
hi green roomers ,
the fall outdoor soccer season is just around the corner and the schedules
have been posted to the gpsd website at
http : / / www . gpsdsoccer . com /
you will be surprised to learn , like i was , that we were not promoted to the lst division . it seems that the league has decided to keep us in 2 nd even
though i registered for and said we would accept the promotion to lst
division in order to be eligible for the championship .
our first game is on sunday sept . 9 th at delta park # 8 ( ne of strasser ) at
12 : 15 . all of the rest of the games in the 10 game season will also be at
12 : 15 and will occur every sunday between sept 9 th and november 18 th with
the exception of sunday october 21 st when we have a bye . we then will have
a championship game in early december since we will win the league again .
right ?
don ' t forget to update your player care if you had a recent birthday or are
new to the team . you update or get a player card at the oasa league office
off of highway 26 at the sylvan exit . they do have odd hours so call them
before you head up there .
anyway that is enough from me . see you soon out on the soccer pitch .
