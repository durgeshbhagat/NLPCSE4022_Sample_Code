Subject: epe electric tags
i received a call from charlie at epe . if possible , when you create a tag for epe , please use a slash instead of a semicolon in the " info section " in the transaction path . apparently they are having problems uploading the tags into their system when semicolons are present . they are trying to fix this problem as soon as they can . see below for more clarification :
for example , instead of g ; fs ; pv and l ; fs use g / fs / pv and l / fs .
