Subject: real time meeting / questions
two things -
1 . weather tracking - did we decide to ask fundamentals about tracking forecasted - to - actual temperatures ? or would you me to organize this specifically for real time ?
2 . bpa transmission losses - would you prefer that we pay back losses on a daily , weekly , or monthly basis ? for billing purposes and general clarity , i think we should keep loss charges separate from actual transmission costs ( i . e . pay them back in an annuity each day , week , or month as opposed to adding them into each reservation charge - too much room for error ) .
also , darin presto and casey anderson should both have 100 % access to the systems they need ; but it seems to be an ongoing process , so we ' ll keep our fingers crossed .
let me know what your thoughts are on these two things .
thanks ,
kate
