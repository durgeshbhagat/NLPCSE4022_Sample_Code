Subject: fsp status report
good afternoon ,
i wanted to give everyone a status report on fsp before i head - out on vacation . in a nutshell , it ' s not quite there . we are now meeting performance targets but we had a few too many bugs to allow users to complete the parallel in - time . i will begin paying my dollar a day debt starting on saturday but i feel fairly confident that we should wrap things up next week . susan amador will be working in portland next week , in my absence , to ensure real - time can finish up their part .
thanks , david poston
here are the details for the remaining 6 days of the parallel :
da preferreds & finals are complete for 5 / 29 - 5 / 31
da preferreds are 99 % complete for 6 / 1 - 6 / 3 . ( * waiting on st - cali to input the last few schedules )
performance figures
template writing = 1 : 30 - 2 : 30 ( target < 3 minutes )
finals processing = 7 minutes ( target < 10 minutes )
bugs
1 remaining critical bug on exercises for supplement schedules , should be finished tomorrow
preliminary schedule ( contingent on no new critical bugs found by real - time )
1 . wrap - up ha parallel first part of next week
2 . migrate code to production end of next week
3 . begin production parallel . as suggested by phil platter , we will continue using the existing toolset but we will write da preferred templates out of fsp at the same time . then we can execute some compare utilities we have developed to ensure the iso templates between caps & fsp match perfectly .
4 . we will run in this mode until the users feel good about fsp .
