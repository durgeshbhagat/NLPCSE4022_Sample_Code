building maintenance somehow got a hold of debra and she knows about the hole in the wall .
i told her i had no idea how it happened . i just wanted you to know .
i basically told her i found the hole and i called on my own . the maintenance people have her number on file
or something , so she was looking around for the original person that called .
sorry . thought i could keep it a secret . you can ' t keep anything from her it seems .
