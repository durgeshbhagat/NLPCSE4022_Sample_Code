Subject: revised real - time generation for saturday 6 / 9
there are a few changes to saturday ' s schedule , so please disregard my previous email .
group ,
the plan has slightly changed for submitting supplemental bids for our generators for saturday , 6 / 9 . the plan is as follows :
only submit supplemental bids for the generators if a stage 1 emergency is called . this is due to the iso ' s ability to ramp the units up and down every 10 minutes . we don ' t want to give them the ability to do this if there is not a stage 1 , 2 , or 3 emergency .
so , please try to sell the generators excess available output as an sc to sc trade . below is their preschedule , mw ' s available , minimum price threshold , and unit id ' s . also , attached is a sheet with all the contact names and phone # ' s . please save it and reference it when dealing with the generators .
harbor : harbgn _ 7 _ units
supps : no action required , they are down for maintenance on saturday .
sc trade : no action required , they are down for maintenance on saturday .
