kourtney ,
just a quick heads up for the flash .
path 26 was derated last night for he 19 through he 24 . for he 24 the price for congestion revenue was $ 247 . 98 . we were awarded 218 mws of congestion relief by the caiso . this should equal $ 54059 . 64 in congestion revenue to ectrt .
if you have any questions , please let me know .
thanks ,
bill
