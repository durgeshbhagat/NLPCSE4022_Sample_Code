how about this ?
evelyn ,
please try to send or copy any emails to me at williams iii , bill . not williams , bill . this email went to bill williams with enron who happen to be in sweden . . .
kate symes will be taking care of your spreadsheet when she has an opportunity . as you may be aware we have recently brought out enrononline to the hourly market . we have seen a dramatic increase in volumes , and priorities have shifted as a result . daily deadlines must be met . we are working on our deal entry accuracy . i appreciate your patience , we will attend to this issue shortly .

please find attached an excel spreadsheet of bloomberg deals i can ' t seem to match up with our deals in enpower . this is for august 1 through august 22 . none of these deals have bloomberg as the broker in enpower . i was told in june to allow a two day grace period before the deals should be in enpower and that did not occur .
please let me know if there is anything i can do to help resolve these problems .
