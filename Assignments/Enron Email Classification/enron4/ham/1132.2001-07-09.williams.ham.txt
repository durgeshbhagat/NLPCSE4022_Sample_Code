Subject: excel issues
i believe i have asked before , but in case i missed you . . .
if you or any of your traders get an error while working in excel about not being able to save , please capture a screen shot and e - mail it to me . i am currently working with microsoft to get this resolved , but they have requested a screen shot of the actual error message .
much thanks ,
