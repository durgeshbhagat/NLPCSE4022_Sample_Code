networks
dear prof . pattichis ,
thank you for your kind invitation to review this paper .
could you please inform me about the time available for the review .
i should also clarify that my knowledge on dynamic programming is limited
and
may not be able to comment on the soundness of the method .
another colleague of mine who may be more appropriate is dr . perantonis
( sper @ iit . demokritos . gr )
best regards ,
