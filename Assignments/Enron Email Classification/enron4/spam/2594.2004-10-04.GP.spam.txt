it traded over $ 1 on october lst , a more than 100 % move in
approximately one month . . you may not know a lot about investing ,
but we ' re sure you can count .
with oil hovering around $ 50 a barrel , select small oil and gas
stocks could continue to get increased investor attention moving
forward .
let ' s look at today ' s featured company , frontier oil and gas ( otc :
fogl )
frontier oil and gas ltd is a chance to operate a successful oil and
gas production company . this company through a 50 / 50 joint venture
with fowlers oil and gas will be penetrating the market in the
business of natural gas and oil production .
the vision of the company is to establish itself and develop a solid
foundation for future growth by developing properties that provide a
balance of short and long term reserves for both natural gas and
oil . the company will establish this through strategic development
partnerships and independently in the future . the company will work
to establish and maintain properties with potential for development
and drilling . the company emphasize will be on production , cash flow
and reserve value .
fowler project
frontier oil and gas brings excellent partners to the table in
fowlers oil and gas . the company is looking to develop both oil and
natural gas reserves located in the cook inlet oil basin in alaska .
ownership of the 80 acres property located in the cook inlet is
owned free and clear by the fowler family for the last 45 years ,
with an additional 7 , 000 adjacent acres to be leased . well spacing
for the owned property will be one ( 1 ) well for every twenty ( 20 )
acres with the possibility of approval for a one ( 1 ) well per ten ( 10 )
acres . current oil reserve is an unproven reserve with an estimated
2 billion barrels . current gas reserve is a fully documented reserve
with an estimated 1 . 9 trillion cubic feet . the development property
in question is within 300 feet of main natural gas feeder pipelines .
corporate vision
frontier is optimistic in regards to its successful participation in
an ever - growing share of the oil and gas marketplace . frontier has
set definite objectives in order to achieve the companies set goals
and believes that there are several key factors that will make
frontier successful .
1 ) the fowler project is lower risk then most oil and gas ventures
due to the following :
the gas field is a proven reserve for cook inlet .
our land is within 300 feet of main natural gas feeder pipelines .
capital needed for the extraction and transportation of the oil will
be internally generated by the gas revenue , and the ability to sell
oil futures for physical delivery in 2 - 3 years .
