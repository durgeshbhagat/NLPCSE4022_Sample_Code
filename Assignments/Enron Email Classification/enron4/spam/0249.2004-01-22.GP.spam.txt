the future
our # 1 national security crisis ? the ultimate growth industry ? secure our borders ? save our nation !
a practical , cost - effective solution to protect our porous borders without more guns , gates and guards . a small company ? s core technology comes to the rescue ? as a new industry takes off .
spsc ? s ? safe borders program ?
as defense corporations go , spsc is tiny - $ 13 million in annual sales ? but with a solid track - record . ( started 21 years ago . ) it is one of those companies you ? ve never heard of ? doing things you never knew existed .
in this case , spsc creates highly sophisticated software products for the department of defense ? manufactures specialized military items ? does airspace and airport planning ? and operates bombing ranges . ( you never knew that business existed , did you ? ! ! )
among other facilities around the country , this company all by itself runs the world ? s second - largest live - fire training range for combat pilots . ( under contract with the u . s . air force . ) this is the huge 2 . 5 million acre barry m . goldwater range in southwestern arizona ? where pilots come to improve their air - to - ground combat skills and practice with live bombs , rockets , missiles and cannon fire . ( most combat pilots who served in the first and second gulf wars were trained at this spsc - operated base . pilots from over a dozen foreign countries also train here . )
but spsc ? s global reputation lies in its proprietary saferange technology , which makes the company a leader in weapons training , used by over 80 organizations around the world . this was developed by spsc ? s founder and chairman , donal myrick , and forms the basis for the revolutionary safeborders technology .
virgin industry = virgin investment
how often have you been present at the birth of an entirely new industry that reflects some overwhelming urgent need ?
? urgent ? ? hell , yes ! what ? s more urgent than our immediate survival ? ! !
that being the case , no matter what happens to the economy , you can be sure this overwhelming need will stay constant . and while nothing is guaranteed , it could also make a pretty good investment . border protection truly represents a universal need ?
the threat from terrorism is growing , no matter how well things go in iraq .
weapons of mass destruction are getting easier to acquire on the black market , and increasingly less complicated to activate .
the need for border protection has reached universal acceptance . the public understands the need for safe borders , and supports massive government funding .
the growth of this virgin industry is soaring , in part because of the federal government ? s heavy spending .
it ? s hard to see how the border protection industry will decline over the coming years . on the other hand , if we ? re hit by some new major act of terrorism , it will probably accelerate further . mass panic would demand even more border protection .
that ? s a realistic view of the industry , but what about individual companies within the border protection industry ? how will they do ? in fact , over the near - term , it would be fairly hard for a company not to do well ? though be careful of quickie start - ups seeking to capitalize on these opportunities . ( opportunistic sleazoids are a fact of life ! )
nevertheless , some companies will do much better than others . so what about spsc ? some points to keep in mind ?
spsc is a 21 - year - old established company , with its own proprietary software ? a world - leader in its field .
spsc has taken proven software and is merely adapting it to meet the needs of this new industry . this is no start - up high - wire act .
final word
spsc will be recognized as the most innovative and dependable provider of management , engineering and manufacturing services , enabling customers to meet critical challenges , maintain effective operations and reduce risk while accomplishing their mission in a cost - effective and timely manner .
