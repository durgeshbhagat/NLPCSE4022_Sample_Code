vancouver , british coiumbia , march 30 , 20 o 5 ( primezone ) - - montana oil
and gas , inc . , ( pink sheets : mogi ) president peter sanders is piease to
announce the foilowing update on its sylvan lake project .
after several delays due to unseasonabie weather and road ciosures in
the province of alberta , the contracted dri | | ing rig was moved onto
| ocation
over the weekend and ensign driiling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m we | |
a
nd are currentiy driliing at 1 , 250 feet . surface casing wiil be run to
930 feet . the driliing rig is known as a teiescopic doubie and is rated
to dri | | to 10 , 000 feet in depth . driliing operations are expected to
be suspended shortiy for a few weeks as the county may impose a
restriction
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring
breakup
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage . this is an annua |
event ,
which occurs in most of centra | and northern canada when the frost ,
which
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground . driiling operations
for
a large rig such as the sylvan lake wel | requires service by heavy
vehicies
such as mud , water , cement and vacuum trucks which will be prohibited
from
using the roads during this period of time . peter sanders notes ,
the road bans that have been taking piace all over alberta happen
every year
and in the spring is no surprise , a | | oil and gas companies are
effected by
breakup , the good thing is , is that we have the rig on site , which will
remain there until we are finished driiling , surface casing has been
compieted and we wiil be ready to finish driliing the minute the road
bans are lifted .
the sylvan lake prospect is a well defined 3 - d seismic structura | high
within a preserved pekisko remnant island that may have virgin
reservoirs
with simiiar production potentia | as the adjacent n poo | where 6 we | | s
have
produced 680 , 000 barrels oil since 1997 . in overa | | , the sylvan field
has
produced 4 o miliion barrels of oil from the pekisko formation and 50
biliion
cubic feet of gas from the shunda formation .
ensign driliing will test a total of 3 o feet from several zones in the
shunda
formation at 7 , 155 feet and a 30 - foot pekisko oil formation at 7 , 320
feet .
when drilling resumes , the hoie is planned to reach a total depth of
7 , 57 o feet ,
which may take some lo days to then compiete driliing and testing .
each deveiopment well has probabie production of 15 o barrels of oi | per
day
and 75 o ? thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1
billion
cubic feet gas and 300 , 000 barreis of oil . there are four other pay
zones that
are prospective for gas . the average wel | in the sylvan lake fieid has
produced
500 barreis of oi | per day and / or over one miliion cubic feet of gas
per day .
if successfu | , the company intends to driil up to 4 more welis on these
| and
sections . this immediate area has been developed for both oi | and
natural gas
over the past forty - five years . accordingiy a muititude of gas
gathering and
processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been
