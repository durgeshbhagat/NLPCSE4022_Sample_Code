one glance inside drpt ' s programming vault will make you
realize that there is basically none of the company ' s
intrinsic value reflected in the price of the stock .
this is a direct result of a stock that is completely
unknown to investors . watch how quickly prices roar when
word spreads , investors grab their calculators , and the
realization is clear that this stock is trading for just
pennies on every dollar of tangible assets .
the value of the company ' s core assets will force its way
into the stock price , with this explosive entity stepping
into the spotlight and evolving drpt into media classics
international , inc . although a new name to investors , media
classics is a major video stock footage company with
worldwide distribution that has amassed a 3 , 000 film product
line since 1994 .
an overview of media classics ' holdings reveals a tremendous
diversity of entertainment media , started from scratch about
ten years ago that has subsequently morphed into an almost
$ 20 million asset empire with top award winning producers
and directors at the helm .
the company ' s entertainment assets are comprised of over
2 , 400 hours of stock film footage , documentary and educational
films , over $ 8 million of animated art and programming ,
distribution rights for 110 full - length feature films
categorized as top box office draws starring oscar winners
and a who ' s - who of hollywood actors , as well as sports
programming , and music rights . this complete library is
distributed worldwide in vhs , dvd , on cable television and
via the internet , and is a continuing source of rapidly
growing revenues .
several recent news announcements are well - timed with the
upcoming corporate name change and will add significant
value to a growing bottom line . these releases include :
1 . the licensing of 36 films for distribution as dvd ' s
and home video through a group of entertainment companies .
2 . the completion of ten ( 10 ) documentaries to be released
within 60 days produced as a joint venture with well -
known terramar productions .
3 . a contract to provide entertainment products to the us
navy for use on board ship and at navy bases around the globe .
here are some figures that put into perspective the enormous
potential revenues that are available to industry players
with diverse entertainment properties . the movie industry
generates $ 150 billion while the entire music industry
yields $ 30 billion worldwide . video rentals in the us totaled
$ 7 billion , video sales reached $ 10 billion , and dvd sales
totaled $ 4 billion for a total of $ 21 billion in post - theatrical
gross profits . with 50 % of the wholesale price of a dvd or
vhs going to the producer or studio , it is clear to aggressive
investors why drpt ( media classics ) has become our # 1 stock
pick for 2004 .
