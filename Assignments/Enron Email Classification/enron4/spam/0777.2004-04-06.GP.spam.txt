of a gold property of approximately 130 , 000 acres in
the amapa state , brazil . this is one of the most prolific
greenstone belts in brazil and has attracted the attention
of many multi - national mining companies . this acquisition
could give globetech a prominent name in the exploration
of this very hot area of exploration . globetech , unlike most
mining companies , has a small number of shares outstanding

is adjacent to wheaton river ' s most promising gold property
and is three times the size of wheaton river ' s newewst gold
play . with a market cap of just over $ 12 million , the is room
for a large percentage move in the price of the shares in

move higher aided by higher gold prices . most gold analysts
are calling for much higher gold prices .
