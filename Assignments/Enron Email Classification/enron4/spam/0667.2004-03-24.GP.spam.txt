could ossi be the next ditech , lending tree , e - loan , or countrywide ? countrywide up 23 , 000 % since 1982 , 156 % in last year alone .
2003 saw one of the the biggest booms in real estate history . homeownership is at its highest level ever at 68 % , and experts are predicting 2004 will be even bigger . in fact , since 2000 the stocks of the ten financial companies that dominate mortgages have risen an average of 78 % . you have all heard of such companies as ditech , lending tree , e - loan , and countrywide . these companies are riding the current wave of record refinancing , posting record revenues and phenomenal gains . for you , the investor , it may very well be too late to get in on the ground floor of these already well - known entities . but is it too late for you to get into this market at all ? absolutely not .
osf financial services - ossi - is just now getting its legs and will soon be up and running at full speed . here is your chance to get in while the getting is good .
to illustrate the rise in stock prices per the real estate boom of 2003 , we can use as an example countrywide financial . 77 % of countrywide ' s pre - tax earnings are derived from mortg . banking . net earnings went from 842 million dollars for the 12 months ended 12 / 31 / 2002 to a whopping 2 billion , 373 million dollars for 12 months ended 12 / 31 / 2003 , with diluted earnings per share going from 4 . 87 in 2002 to 12 . 47 in 2003 .
52 - week range - 37 . 96 - 97 . 30
fourth quarter highlights include the following :
consolidated net earnings reached 564 million dollars , advancing 121 percent over fourth quarter last year .
earnings per diluted share increased 89 percent over last year to 2 . 74 , the company ' s second highest quarter on record . notably , the company ' s liquid yield option notes became convertible during the fourth quarter , resulting in an upswing in the number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter of 10 . 4 million . this had a dilutive effect on fourth quarter earnings of 0 . 14 per share and on annual earnings of 0 . 17 per share .
pre - tax earnings from diversified businesses were 246 million dollars , a gain of 122 percent over last year ' s fourth quarter .
incredible gains .
countrywide financial was established in 1969 , but you can see an astounding rise in stock value came last year , coinciding with a never before seen real estate boom . just last year alone stock value was up an est . % 156 .
according to shawn tully from fortune magazine :
most amazing of all is that countrywide boasts the best stock market performance of any financial services company in the fortune 500 , measured from the start of the great bull market over two decades ago . during that period , it has delivered investors a 23 , 000 % returnyes , 23 , 000 % or 30 % a year , so that shareholders now have over $ 230 , 000 for every $ 1 , 000 they invested in late 1982 . it handily beat superstars wamu , wal - mart , and warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway ( all around 15 , 000 % ) .
the time has come and gone to get in early with countrywide , but the time is right for ossi .
