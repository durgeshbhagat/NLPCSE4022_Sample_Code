major breaking news !
canadian oil sands extraction solution ! sequoia ' s diamondflo
displaces oil from tar sands in lab tests .
tuesday september 14 , 10 : 55 am et
here is an excerpt from that announcement :
houston - - ( business wire ) - - sept . 14 , 2004 - - sequoia interests
corporation ( pink sheets : sqnc - news ) , developer of a new
proprietary enhanced oil recovery chemical formulation , is very
pleased to report the company ' s diamondflo ( tm ) has yielded stellar
results in displacing oil from canadian tar sand samples in
laboratory tests . diamondflo ( tm ) displaced a significant quantity of
the adhered oil from tar sand samples in the initial feasibility
tests . work is now underway to define the precise degree of oil
removal and to optimize the oil removal process using
diamondflo ( tm ) .
the canadian tar sands fields are recognized as the mother lode of
hydrocarbons on earth . conservative estimates of oil reserves in the
surrounding area of fort mcmurray , alberta , canada total 1 . 6
trillion barrels of oil , of which 330 billion barrels of oil are
deemed recoverable . by comparison , saudi arabia has proven reserves
of 262 billion barrels of oil . a primary difficulty in developing
the tar sands region is extraction . the oil does not flow as crude
from other oil producing regions but is more akin to a molasses - like
sand . separation of oil from the sands is the major challenge to
development . ( press release source : sequoia interests corp . )
what if a company had a product that would allow oil wells to
produce much more oil ?
what would that stock be worth with today ' s oil prices close to 45
per barrel ?
10 , 20 , 30 , 100 dollars ? and now several of the major oil companies
are currently testing the product . at 0 . 95 we think sqnc is a
homerun .
about the company : sequoia interests ( sqnc . pk )
to solve this problem , the oil industry is looking for new
alternatives for increased exploration and production . the clear
solution for increased demand and consumption can already be found
in the ground , with nearly two thirds of oil left in the ground at
us wells , too technically complex or expensive to extract with
traditional technologies . enhanced oil recovery ( eor ) is an exciting
new frontier in the oil and gas industry which you are guar - anteed
to hear more of in the coming years . typically , eor involved gasses
and heat to stimulate oil flow and recover fluids in ground after
primary and secondary production has ended , but these eor
technologies have proven to be cumbersome and costly .
sqnc has already recei - ved strong interest from major oil and gas
companies for testing and potential licensing of this product , and
is in the final stages of the research and development of
diamondflo . with testing expected to be completed in the next 60 - 90
days , and planned patent application shortly thereafter , we expect
major announcements from sqnc will cause major price gains for this
stock over the coming months ! what is more , diamondflos unique
chemical properties , make it an ideal solution for a number of other
application in the oil & gas industry , including remediation and
environmental cleanup of oil fields , refineries , and storage
facilities - an estimated $ 8 . 1 billion market opportunity ! with this
revolutionary product in the development pipeline , sqnc has also
made some aggressive moves into oil and gas production with its
recent acquisition of leases in pecos valley , texas . these
operations will act as a test - bed for development and validation of
the diamondflo product and provide an additional revenue stream and
source of cash flow for sqnc .
sqnc is one of the hottest investment opportunities we have seen in
the past year , and with commercialization of its diamondflo product
looming near , we feel that it is only a matter of time before wall
street recognizes this undervalued stock . what is more , sqnc is
positioned within an industry that has seen tremendous upside
growth , and is headed for even more appreciation as the global oil
crisis demands new production solutions . over the last twelve
months , the oil well services & equipment industry has seen an
average price gain of more than 88 % , and savvy investors in emerging
companies have witnessed tremendous profits . we believe that sqnc is
one of the most revolutionary new companies on the market , and
presents a money - making opportunity that cannot be missed . with
major announcements stemming from the completion of r and d on
diamondflo , sqnc should make a nice move in the coming days .
a few reasons to own sqnc :
1 . with its innovative diamondflo product , sqnc is positioned to
help alleviate the impending oil and gas crisis , with producers
struggling to keep up with growing us energy demands , as foreign
exploration and production comes under increasing geopolitical
pressures . increased consumption demands have combined with an
increasingly unstable international production climate to create
some of the highest prices seen at the pump since the 1970 s oil
embargo , and crude oil prices on the spot market have recently
approached the $ 50 mark . as oil companies seek new ways to maximize
domestic oil recovery , the chemical eor approach of sqnc will be a
major factor in increasing production and removing dependence on
foreign oil .
2 . enhanced oil recovery ( eor ) represents the logical next step in
expanding domestic oil production , and represents a tremendous and
presently underappreciated market potential . over two thirds of oil
in us reservoirs is left unproduced after primary and secondary
production , leaving an incredible and untapped source for us energy
needs . according to the us department of energy , eor has the
potential to recover 35 billion barrels of oil , 50 % more than the
current us proven reserves of 23 billion barrels , and even greater
than the us estimated undiscovered potential of 30 billion barrels .
with its diamondflo chemical eor solution , sqnc is ideally
positioned to benefit from a renewed focus on production from these
untapped oil reserves .
3 . sqnc has developed a revolutionary chemical eor product ,
diamondflo which offers tremendous advantages over thermal and gas
eor methods . thermal and gas ( primarily co 2 injection to stimulate
production are costly and require a complex infrastructure , while
other chemical eor products have had limited success and are
environmentally damaging . by contrast , diamondflo is expected to
generate recovery of 20 - 40 % above current methods , is
environmentally safe and meets strict regulatory standards for oil
recovery and remediation , and will be available to producers at a
comparable price point to competitive products . with introduction of
diamondflo to the market following completion of testing and
development , sqnc is poised to revolutionize the oil and vp of r and d ron knocke has been a
senior technical and management personnel in the petroleum industry
with positions at core laboratories and ngpl , in addition to project
development and evaluation which have resulted in the discovery of
more than $ 125 million in recoverable reserves .
