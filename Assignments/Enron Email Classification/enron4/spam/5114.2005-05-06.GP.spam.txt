with oil prices now well over $ 50 and near - constant international
instability highlighting the vulnerability of the us and world economies to
petroleum supply shortages , the use of renewable , alternative energy sources has
taken on new and immediate importance . .
some of the most widespread and feasible of these new technologies are
already being incorporated into everyday usage - foremost among these is the use
of ethanol fuel as an oxygenator in petroleum to reduce emissions and as an
alternative fuel source . ethanol is already blended in approximately 30 %
of us gasoline as an environmental additive , while the use of rfg ( reformulated
gasoline ) could more than double demand . according to industry estimates ,
in 2004 the use of ethanol fuel helped to reduce the average cost of gasoline by
nearly 30 cents per gallon , while it reduced over 7 million tons of
co 2 - equivalent greenhouse gas emissions . government regulatory measures
including epact and clean air standards , as well as new policies banning the use
of mtbte are acting as a major catalyst towards ethanol industry growth - with an
estimated 3 . 4 billion gallons used in the us in 2004 , demand is expected to
skyrocket to more than 12 billion by 2010 .
in spite of this tremendous and growing demand , however , there is a
significant and serious ethanol supply crunch - driving up prices of ethanol on
the open market , spurring major government interest and wall street
investment . ethanol production has traditionally been a costly and complex
endeavor , requiring heavy subsidies to coax producers to ramp up their
operations to meet demand . there are currently 81 ethanol plants in the
us , capable of producing 3 . 6 billion gallons annually - a figure that is barely
adequate to meet current demand , let alone keep up with future demand . the
ethanol industry is struggling to meet this demand with 16 additional plants and
an annual capacity of 800 million gallons already under construction . it
is no surprise then , that the street is eagerly awaiting new investment
opportunities in the ethanol and clean energy industries - a trend which has been
validated by the recent high - profile $ 250 million merger of pacific ethanol ,
inc . ( nasdaq : peix ) with accessity corp . to form the first us - based pure - play
ethanol company .
with this in mind , we would like to introduce you to our newest profile
company , trinity technologies , inc . ( otc pink sheets : tntg ) , a name which you
will soon be hearing about in the $ 35 billion renewable energy industry and
which is making huge moves in ethanol and clean energy markets . tntg has
developed a substantial intellectual property and alternative energy technology
portfolio which promise tremendous revenue growth over the near term
period . triton technologies , inc . is a rapidly emerging provider of
renewable and clean energy and environmental technologies to lucrative global
industrial and commercial markets . the company has developed a substantial
technology portfolio of innovative new technologies , with operations including
production of high - grade ethanol fuel ; rechargeable battery manufacturing ; and
ultra - pure drinking water production . tntg has developed an innovative new
ethanol production technology , capable of meeting huge global demand fuel , which
can use alternative feedstock , and is roughly ½ the production cost of
competitive methods . with construction of two major production facilities
slated for later this year , we believe that tntg is ready to emerge as a major
player in the $ 35 billion alternative energy industry ! ! special situation

why shares undervalued ?
1 . ttng has developed a leading ethanol production technology which
will utilize alternative feedstock to produce ethanol at a significant discount
to competitive fermentation production methods - an estimated $ 0 . 80 per gallon
compared to industry standard costs of $ 1 . 50 per gallon . 2 . through its
starbourn - triton operation , scheduled to open two ethanol production facilities
in ohio and the united kingdom , ttng is well positioned at the forefront of an
explosive growth ethanol market which is expected to grow from $ 6 . 8 billion in
2003 to more than $ 24 billion by 2010 at it is increasingly used as a fuel
oxygenate and energy alternative . 3 . ttng additionally has acquired
manufacturing rights for new rechargeable battery manufacturing facilities in
the us and italy , which will produce battery packs that will outperform the
competition with 30 % greater life expectancy - positioning ttng at the forefront
of a high growth $ 5 . 2 billion rechargeable battery market . 4 . titan is
also addressing lucrative markets for clean water with its licensed equus water
purification technology and system which can produce pure and potable water from
any feed water source . this system will produce clean water from impure
source water at an average cost of less than $ 200 per acre - foot , compared to
prevailing industry costs of $ 1000 per acre - foot . 5 . tntg anticipates
tremendous near - term revenue growth with construction of its first two ethanol
production facilities , ramp - up in battery operations , and sales of its equus
system . tntg expects to realize sales of of approximately $ 28 million
during fiscal 2005 alone ! ! ! 6 . tntg has built a first - class management
team composed of experienced executives in the alternative energy , technology ,
and manufacturing industries . ceo christopher zanardi has spent a career
in the marketing and product management of new and clean energy technologies ,
while coo russell hilbourn has spent over twenty five years in public and
private sector management in the energy industry .
this is an investment opportunity that you cannot afford to miss - we
think the time is ideal for an investment which will see huge short - term profits
while investing in a future conglomerate with a tremendous long - term
outlook . tntg is uniquely positioned to see major revenues and profitable
operations over the next fiscal year as it completes construction of its first
ethanol production facilities . we urge you to consider investing now ,
while trading levels are still low and before the investment community
recognizes the inherent potential of this clean energy conglomerate in the
making . as the company begins to see revenues from its ethanol sales , and
embarks on additional clean energy and environmental technology ventures , this
stock will see major price gains ! ! ! this stock could justifiably reach
trading levels of up to $ 2 . 50 within the next several trading weeks ! ! !
