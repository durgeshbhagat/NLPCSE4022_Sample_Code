Subject: bank statement of account
dear friend ,
i have a proposal for you , this however is not mandatory nor will i in any
manner compel you to honour against your will .
i am mr maxwell ibeanusi , an auditor with a bank ( one of the african leading banks
in the west coast ) . here in this bank existed a dormant account for the past
8 years which belong to a american national who is now late mr morris thompson
who died on alaska airlines flight 261 . http : / / archives . cnn . com / 2000 / us / 02 / 01 / alaska . airlines . list /
more details about the deceased himself , you can check on
when i discovered that there had been no deposits nor withdrawals from this
account for this long period , i decided to carry out a system investigation
and discovered that non of the family member nor relations of the late person
is aware of this account . this is the story in a nutshell .
now i want an account overseas where the bank will transfer this funds . thereafter ,
i had planned to destroy all related documents for this account . it is a
careful network and for the past eleven months i have worked out everything
to ensure a hitch - free operation . the amount is not so much at the moment
and plus all the accumulated interest the balance in this account stands
at - ( us $ 15 . 4 million us dollars ) .
now my questions are : -
1 . can you handle this project ?
2 . can i give you this trust ?
3 . what will be your commission if you can assist us with this transfer ?
consider this and get back to me as soon as possible .
finally , it is our humble prayer that the information as contained herein
be accorded the necessary attention , urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves .
i expect your urgent response if you can handle this project . i am
expecting your urgent response as soon as you receive my message .
respectfully yours ,
mr maxwell ibeanusi .
