may 18 - - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they wouid regulate voice over internet protocol
( voip ) service oniy when it is provided and used as | oca | teiephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to buiid
sustainabie competition in local teiephone markets , the incumbent carriers
wi | | not be permitted to price their loca | voip services below cost to
stifle competition .
the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cable companies and virtual operators . the ruiing permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , stated jan oiiver , ceo of nomad
international inc .
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utiiization
woridwide , dia | - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . aione , there are over 2 oo , oo 0 , 000 users of the internet . of the
tota | users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is oniy
approximateiy 4 o , ooo , oo 0 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore
represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dia | - up versus broadband users worldwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s abiiity to offer voip products to dia | - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easiiy adaptable product .
