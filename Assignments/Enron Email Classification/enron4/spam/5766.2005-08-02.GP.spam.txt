summer suit - - was short , dark - haired , well - fed and bald . he carried his
decorous pork - pie hat by the brim and his neatly shaven face was embellished
by black hornrimmed spectacles of preternatural dimensions . the other , a
broad - shouldered young man with curly reddish hair and a check cap pushed
back to the nape of his neck , was wearing a tartan shirt , chewed white
trousers and black sneakers .

a highbrow literary magazine and chairman of the management cofnmittee of
one of the biggest moscow literary clubs , known by its abbreviation as
