and gas , inc . , ( pink sheets : mogi ) president peter sanders is please to
announce the foilowing update on its syivan lake project .
after several delays due to unseasonabie weather and road closures in
the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig was moved onto
location
over the weekend and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m weil
a
nd are currently driiling at 1 , 250 feet . surface casing will be run to
930 feet . the dri | | ing rig is known as a telescopic double and is rated
to drill to lo , oo 0 feet in depth . driiling operations are expected to
be suspended shortiy for a few weeks as the county may impose a
restriction
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring
breakup
as heavy vehicies may cause severe road damage . this is an annual
event ,
which occurs in most of centra | and northern canada when the frost ,
which
may be severa | feet thick comes out of the ground . driiling operations
for
a large rig such as the sylvan lake we | | requires service by heavy
vehicles
such as mud , water , cement and vacuum trucks which wiil be prohibited
from
using the roads during this period of time . peter sanders notes ,
§ the road bans that have been taking piace ail over alberta happen
every year
and in the spring is no surprise , ail oi | and gas companies are
effected by
breakup , the good thing is , is that we have the rig on site , which wiil
remain there until we are finished driiling , surface casing has been
compieted and we wiil be ready to finish dri | | ing the minute the road
bans are lifted .
the syivan lake prospect is a wel | defined 3 - d seismic structural high
within a preserved pekisko remnant isiand that may have virgin
reservoirs
with simiiar production potentia | as the adjacent n pool where 6 welis
have
produced 680 , 0 oo barreis oil since 1997 . in overal | , the syivan field
has
produced 40 million barrels of oil from the pekisko formation and 5 o
biilion
cubic feet of gas from the shunda formation .
ensign drilling will test a tota | of 3 o feet from several zones in the
shunda
formation at 7 , 155 feet and a 30 - foot pekisko oi | formation at 7 , 320
feet .
when drilling resumes , the hoie is planned to reach a total depth of
7 , 57 o feet ,
which may take some lo days to then complete driliing and testing .
each deveiopment weil has probable production of 150 barrels of oi | per
day
and 75 o ? thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1
biliion
cubic feet gas and 3 oo , 000 barreis of oi | . there are four other pay
zones that
are prospective for gas . the average wel | in the syivan lake field has
produced
5 oo barreis of oil per day and / or over one miliion cubic feet of gas
per day .
if successful , the company intends to drill up to 4 more welis on these
land
sections . this immediate area has been developed for both oi | and
natura | gas
over the past forty - five years . accordingiy a multitude of gas
gathering and
processing facilities and oil transportation faciiities have been
constructed .
