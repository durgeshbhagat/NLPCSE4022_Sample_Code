subject : using ling - spam for discourse analysis
dear mr . androutsopoulos ,
i just wanted to let you know i found the ling - spam corpus on your
website and wanted to notify you that i am using several spam e - mail
examples taken from your corpus for a final paper . i am a student of
computational linguistics at the university of potsdam in germany
( www . ling . uni - potsdam . de / cl ) and i ' m currently writing about the
discourse structure of spam e - mails for a seminar on discourse and
dialogue structure .
thanks for the corpus ( even though i don ' t do any spam filtering with
it ) - - best regards ,
dorothee lohmann
