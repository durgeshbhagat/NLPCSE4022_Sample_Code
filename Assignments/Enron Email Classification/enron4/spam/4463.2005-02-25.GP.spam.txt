after further investigation , it was discovered that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin proved abortive and futile . as a matter of fact and on further investigation , it was discovered that late mr . andreas schranner did not declare any next of kin or relatives in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paper work here in our bank . this fund is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one will ever and has come forward to lay claim to it . in strict accordance with the british banking laws and constitution , at the expiration of 5 ( five ) years , the money will revert to the british government treasury if nobody applies as the next of kin to claim the funds . all i need from you is to play the role as next of kin , the bank will work with verifiable documents which i have . upon acceptance of this proposal , i shall send to you the bankers trust international banks next of kin payment application form as well as detailed information on how this transaction would be carried out . we shall employ the services of a solicitor for the drafting of the last will testament of late mr . andreas schranner and to obtain all other relevant papers in your name for the necessary documentation for payment approval in your favor . i did my homework thoroughly and very well before contacting you .
