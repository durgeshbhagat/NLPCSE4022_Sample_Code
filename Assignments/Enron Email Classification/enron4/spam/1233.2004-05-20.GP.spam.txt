major contract announcements and

dpri has been saving the largest insurance companies in the us $ millions
for over 14 years by performing defective product and fire investigations and
air quality analysis . the number of annual product inspections performed by
dpri with regard to investigating defects has tripled to 10 , 000 per year up
from 3 , 000 three years ago as insurers see the financial rewards of
identifying the exact cause of a defective or failed product .
dpri reported positive earnings of . 04 cents per share in 2003 with . 07 cents
per share expected for the current year . the stock should be trading
conservatively at over 1 . 50 on the strength of those figures .
dpri ' s client base reads like a who ' s - who of the insurance industry
including allstate , fireman ' s fund , hartford , liberty mutual , nationwide ,
prudential , republic , state farm and travelers . dpri has the largest and
most thorough database in the us for identifying product defects that are
responsible for hundreds of millions in damage . dpri has little to no
competitors in this arena and just signed a contract for a single company to
pay them $ 1 million for access to this database over a 10 year period . that ' s
just one company out of hundreds that can ' t afford to be without this
valuable information .
billionaire - financial genius warren buffet has grown his berkshire
hathaway empire ( trading at over $ 80 , 000 per share ) on the explosive cash
flow from 3 insurance subsidiaries : national indemnity , geico , and
reinsurance giant general re .
dpri is being force - fed ever increasing amounts of business by the leading
core of this very successful sector but has remained below the radar of
investors , thus creating a share price that is artificially undervalued . dpri
has the proven experience that fosters escalating revenues and growth . based
on the very small float and the ability for the stock to jump sharply on any
real volume , upcoming news and continuous profits will lead to increased
exposure in conjunction with a soaring stock price .
we are expecting significant upcoming news regarding increased revenues
and contract expansion from dpri ' s fortune 500 customer base . look for
record volume and price appreciation as dpri may very well be one of the
most undervalued stocks on the otcbb !
