a few reasons to own dcpi :
digital color print , inc . ( dcpi ) , through it ' s wholly owned subsidiary logical
imaging solutions ( lis ) , is in the business of supplying high - speed digital
printing systems and supplies to the commercial printing industry . the printing
systems are unique in technical concept and application . the systems are totally
digital , designed to mount on existing offset web presses and significantly
improve the functionality of the press , not as a replacement - but as an
enhancement . the printing process is called electron beam imaging ( ebi ) , and
is significantly faster the convention laser printing - the only partially
competing technology .
printing is america ' s third largest manufacturing industry ; employing more than
1 . 2 million people in almost 46 , 000 establishments . the printing industry ,
during 2002 , produced over $ 165 billion of printed products and purchased $ 4 . 5
billion of hardware and $ 7 . 7 billion of consumable products . nyse - listed dover
corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses , estimates that
there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a press costing
from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of consumable
products per month .
offset presses print all types of documents ; forms , labels , tickets , tags ,
advertisements and direct mail pieces , at production rates of 500
pages - per - minute ( ppm ) to thousands of ppm . however , the printed materials
produced are each identical , as each image printed is the offset inked image
derived from the printing plates that are mounted on the offset press . the great
limitations of the offset process are that each image ( page ) remains identical
unless the printing plates are changed . also the inking of the plates requires
the laborious tasks of mixing the inks for each plate , inking the plates and
then cleaning the press for the next job . if the print job requires variable
information , such as ; name , address , bar codes , dates , prices , this must be
added in a distinctly separate print operation . typically this task is performed
by expensive data processing laser printers , manufactured by either xerox , ibm
or oce ' ( formerly , siemens printing systems ) . the laser printers print only in
black .
lis printing systems are designed to mount directly on most offset web presses
and allow for the printing of any type of data or graphics , without limitation ,
and in line with the offset presses traditional production of a colorful end
product . as a simple example : in the production of an event ticket such as a superbowl
ticket , all fixed or non - variable information , such as the colorful
photo - quality front cover and the stadium rules and disclaimers on the reverse
side of the ticket are produced by plates on an offset press ; identical
information on each ticket . a second printing process is then required to add
the variable information , which includes the section , seat and row numbers ,
price and date of the event . this function can be accomplished , in line , by an
lis provided system .
lis printing systems are entirely digital and are dry toner based , which
precludes the laborious press set - up and clean - up tasks , ink mixing and storage
and the production of printing plates . the pressman simply runs the paper
directly through lis ' s printer and it becomes an integral part of the press and
the starting and stopping of the press and the placement of the digital object
on the page are all under the control of lis proprietary software .
nyse - listed dover corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses ,
estimates that there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a
press costing from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of
consumable products per month . dcpi ' s digitalcolorpress was designed to be
installed on the majority of these presses , extending their life and utility by
providing the printing of computer generated variable data in - line with the
offset printing function . further , the system eliminates the need for preparing
and storing printing plates , and inks and the expensive tasks of setting up a
press for a print run , followed by tearing down after each job , cleaning the
press and setting up for the next print job . dcpi estimates that the majority of
printers will upgrade to color during the first two years of the
digitalcolorpress availability and thousands more commercial printers will
purchase systems through dcpi ' s direct sales force and distribution channel
during the next two years .
dcpi ' s first growth step is to increase consumable inventory to support existing
lis systems , each installation generates about $ 6 , 000 per month in consumable
purchases . secondly , to make lis ' s unique color press available from inventory
and expand the current number of installed sites . thirdly , make the product
offering available to the commercial printing industry . large tasks , but
currently without any perceived competition or technological limitation .
this stock will see major upward movement in the next several weeks . right
now , dcpi is one of the street ' s best kept secrets , but it will not remain that
way for long . this is a unique opportunity to get in while trading levels are
still low . as the company goes forward with its business plan and signs major
new contracts , this stock will move quickly . this is your last chance to invest
before dcpi begins major price appreciation . this stock could reach $ 3 . 50 in the
next five trading days !
