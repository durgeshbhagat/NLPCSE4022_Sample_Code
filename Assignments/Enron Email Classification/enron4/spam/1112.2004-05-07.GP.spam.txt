dear sir / madam ,
first of all let me introduce myself to you . my name are mr . safi
lopi , a consulting auditor of prime banks here in south africa .
without wasting much time , let me go straight to the point . on june
6 , 1998 , there was an american mining onsultant / contractor with the
south african mining corporation , mr . gregory a . williams who made a
numbered time ( fixed ) deposit with my bank here for twelve calendar
months , value us $ 14 , 200 , 000 . 00 an account . on maturity , the bank sent
a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply
from him .
after a month , the bank sent another reminder and finally his contract
employers , the south african mining corporation wrote to inform the
bank that mr . gregory a . williams died from an automobile accident , that
he died without making a will attached to the account , and all
attempts by the american embassy to trace his next of kin was
fruitless .
i therefore , made further investigation and discovered that
mr . gregory a . williams in fact was an immigrant from jamaica and only
recently obtained american citizenship . he did not declare any kin or
relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit
paper work . this money total u s $ 14 , 200 , 000 . 00 is still sitting in
my bank as dormant account .
no one will ever come forward to claim it , and according to south
african banking policy , after 5 years , the money will revert to the
ownership of the south african government if the account owner is
certified dead . this is the situation , and my proposal is that i am
looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to
mr . gregory a . williams , and a bank account abroad will then facilitate
the transfer of this money to the beneficiary / next of kin .
this is simple , all you have to do is to immediately send me a bank
old account or you set up a new account anywhere in the world for me
to arrange the proper money transfer paperwork . this money total usd
( $ 14 . 2 m ) will then be paid into this account for us to share in the
ratio of 60 % for me , 35 % for you and 5 % for expenses that might come
up during transfer process . there is no risk at all , and all the
paper work for this transaction will be done by me using my position
and connection in the banks in south africa .
please observe the utmost confidentiality , and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country .
i look forward to your earliest reply through my email address .
thanks and god bless you and your family and bless me too .
have a nice day .
yours truly .
mr . safi lopi .
