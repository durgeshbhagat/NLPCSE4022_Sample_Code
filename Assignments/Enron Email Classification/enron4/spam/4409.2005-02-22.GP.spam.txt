coloring and rectangular shape , it almost leaves you wondering exactly what
the big deal is . turn the handset on its side , however , and the wow factor begins .
measuring 3 . 8 by 2 . 0 today ' s beautiful moments are tomorrow ' s beautiful memories . by 0 . 5 inches and weighing 3 . 3 ounces , the
razr v 3 is so pocket - friendly and portable that it ' s smaller than many wallets .

and the burly hinge ensures the phone snaps open and shut with authority . we
couldn ' t help noticing the v 3 is wider and bit taller than many flip phones ,

screen acts as a viewfinder when the flip is closed . controls on the outside
of the phone are few . a voice - recorder button sits on the right side of the
front flap , while a volume rocker and a dedicated camera key sit on the left ;
when the phone is open , count your blessings instead of your crosses , the camera button acts as a third soft

( paramahansa yogananda ) no one would remember the good samaritan if he had only good intentions . he had money as well . ( margaret thatcher ) cheerfulness is contagious , but don ' t wait to catch it from others . be a " carrier " . sign at animal shelter , children left unattended will be given a puppy or a kitten .
some people complain because the roses have thorns . sticks and stones can break my bones , but words can shatter my soul . confrontation doesn ' t always bring a solution to the problem , but until you confront the problem , there will be no solution .
