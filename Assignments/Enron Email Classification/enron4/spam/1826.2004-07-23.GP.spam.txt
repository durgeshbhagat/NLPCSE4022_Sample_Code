this system wasn ' t flawless either . the government of the people couldn ' t do good to the people itself . there might have been a change of system , but for us , the common men , it only brought " another government " . too much freedom didn ' t bring us too much prosperity . it became more and more difficult to make both ends meet . i lost my job and i would wander like a dog in search of work . mia got sick because of malnutrition . i would come home late in the night and would get out early in the morning . we were running our lives somehow . there wasn ' t much of a conversation between mia and i . perhaps there wasn ' t anything left to talk about .
