announcement by the canadian radio - teievision and telecommunications

the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its

broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utiiization
woridwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . aione , there are over 200 , ooo , 00 o users of the internet . of the
tota | users in the u . s . , the tota | number of users of broadband is oniy
approximately 4 o , ooo , oo 0 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dia | - up therefore
represents approximateiy 80 % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dia | - up versus broadband users woridwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dia | - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketpiace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easiiy adaptable product .
