solving a dual crisis - waste and energy :
leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of
their biosphere process system to generate revenue from
the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7
tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste
problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process
converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials
as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes ,
medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil ,
sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . leth
profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega -
watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish
the local or national grid .
record backlog of sales for leth :
during the past year , over 20 biosphere process systems have
been ordered , which upon completion represents a backlog
exceeding over $ 100 million in upcoming sales . many of these
contractual agreements include options for the purchase of
additional biosphere systems in the future once the initial
order has been completed . the options vary from hundreds to
thousands of units per contract which would send shockwaves
through this low - float , emerging industry leader at an average
sale price of $ 7 million per biosphere process system !
financing of $ 250 million positions leth for astronomical sales :
the magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than
the fact that leth trading at around $ 2 . 00 , now has accessible
capital equivalent to $ 8 . 62 per common share in cash . there
are 26 biosphere process systems presently in operation worldwide .
the available funding could easily be used to produce 100
additional biospheres . now factor in that the average sale price
is $ 7 million per biosphere . we cannot even comprehend what this
stock should be trading for with a potential $ 700 , 000 , 000 in
future sales with 29 million shares outstanding !
political power fosters rapid global expansion :
leth has captured the profit - making attention of both us and
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate
electricity from alternative sources . this has been accomplished
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from
dr . albert reynolds , chairman of leth , who is also the former
prime minister of ireland . dr . reynolds international stature
has been instrumental in guiding leth into a position of
worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand
that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market .
uncommon value for a company of this caliber :
we are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the biosphere ,
the impressive backlog of over $ 100 million in sales orders , and
the company ' s very solid financial position . we view this perfectly
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the company ' s
own sales records . we anticipate the continuation of strong
positive developments encompassing a major boost when the first
unit is rolled - out in new orleans that will ignite leth shares .
leth carries our highest rating for short - term trading profits
followed by robust long - term capital gains for aggressive
portfolios looking for homerun performance .
