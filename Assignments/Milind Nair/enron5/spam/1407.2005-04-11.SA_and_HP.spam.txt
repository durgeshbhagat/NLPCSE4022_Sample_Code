( otcbb : vnbl -
news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth
opportunities
in the areas of homeiand security , security information systems , and
other
security services , announced today that it pians to offer products and
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and
contro | of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in
the
oil & gas and petrochemical industries .
aithough smail wireiessiy networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possible probiems before they become serious , they
can
also deiiver safety features within oi | weils . oil maybe trapped in
different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of
specific
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a wel | filling with water .
as with other rf based technoiogy applications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handier , and limit the
entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personne | safety is
essential , should there be an emergency at a faciiity , rfid tags would
enabie the customer to track and evaiuate its employee ' s safety and / or
danger . this appiication technology requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentiaily hazardous conditions , but gives
vaiuable
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid
can
aiso assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and
chemical
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level .
vinoble ' s viewpoint as previousiy stated is that these appiications are
more
than just a vaiuable too | to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natura | resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fueis and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company believes that such offering service and technoiogy
appiication
in the oi | & gas and petrochemica | industry wil | further position
vinoble in
a rapidiy expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the
increasing capital and globa | spending that the company wiil require
for
growth . the company ' s goal is to aiso provide a much - needed service at
a
cost manageable to even the smaliest of businesses that can ' t afford to
do
without the safety of its personne | and assets in this current state of
constant threat .
this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is
exceptiona | . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truiy
innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock .
