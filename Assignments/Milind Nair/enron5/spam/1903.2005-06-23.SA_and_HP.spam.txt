panda software ranks famous people most often used to spread computer viruses
a coordinated attack with four species of malware featuring an image of
michael jackson marks a resurgence in the use of famous names to
distribute malware on the internet .
the recent distribution of a new type of malware , detected by panda software
as downloader . dbr , by mass mailing messages to users around the world and
using a spoof story about a suicide attempt by michael jackson , is nothing more
than a new episode in social engineering : exploiting the popularity of certain celebrities
to increase the propagation of this type of threat .
the strategy used to spread this malware is actually quite complex : the
message , which has been distributed manually as spam across the
internet , contains a link to web page . this page , by means of an
example of malware detected by panda software as phel . j , exploits a
browser vulnerability to insert inor . ak , an html application , on
computers . this in turn provides the access needed to install
downloader . dbr on the user ' s computer . however the malicious chain
doesn ' t end there . once installed on computers , this trojan downloads
the au variant of the dedler worm , which actually takes the malicious action on the infected computer .
this is not the first time that michael jackson has been used as bait
to distribute this kind of threat : last november a mail was distributed
supposedly containing a link to a website from which users could
download a video of jackson with a child . this video did not exist , but
instead a trojan was downloaded onto the computer .
even though it is not usual for such complex coordinated techniques to
be used to install malware on computers , the names of celebrities are
frequently used to distribute mails which either contain malware
attached to the mail itself ( often camouflaged as an image ) , or which
contain a url where the malware is accessed ( as in this case ) . trojans
in themselves do not generally have the capacity to propagate ( as worms
do ) , and so this type of strategy is needed for the message to spread .
at the top of this particular celebrity virus ranking is britney spears ,
who , according to data from pandalabs , has been the involuntary protagonist
of most attacks over the last years . attractive female celebrities are
often used for these purposes as the excuse for sending the mail is
often to entice users with the promise of interesting photos . along
these lines , third and fourth respectively in the ranking come jennifer
lopez ( unfortunately associated to the famous loveletter ) and shakira .
porn stars are also often used for this purpose .
the second person most frequently used by malware creators to
distribute their works is microsoft owner , bill gates , and fifth in the
list is osama bin laden . the latter has been the subject of e - mails
claiming that he has been hung , or finally caught , and the spread of
these messages increased after the iraq war .
other famous people who have been used in this context include anna
kournikova , who was the subject of a widespread example of malware
bearing her name , bill clinton , pamela anderson , and even alberto
fujimori , the former president of peru .
the ranking of famous people most frequently used is :
