Subject: investment / partnership proposal ( very urgent )
good day ,
i am mr . olufemi olugbade , a bank executive . i am sending this message to you in
confidence and i am asking for your favour in the transfer of some money
belonging to one mr . barry kelly ( deceased ) whose death we were not aware of
until we no longer got replies to our routine notifications to his forwarding
address .
we were however told by his employers that he died from an automobile crash .
now , all attempts to trace his next of kin have proved abortive . there is
however no trace in any of his official documents of a next of kin .
please understand that the basic line here is that upon the expiration of
6 years , the money would revert to the ownership of the government . please also
understand that nobody is ever going to claim this money having 5 and a half
years in our bank .
so , all i am asking from you is that you should stand in as the next of kin to
avoid the money going into the hands of corrupt government officials . also note
that it is impossible for the money to leave the coffers of the bank without a
next of kin , who also must be a foreigner .
further workings of this initiative , and a sharing ratio plus posible areas of
investment would be discussed as soon as i hear from you .
best regards ,
olufemi olugbade
