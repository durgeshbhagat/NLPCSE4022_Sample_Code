on behalf of smsmobility , inc . ( pink sheets : smso ) ( the company ) president rod burns , is pleased to report that the company has negotiated an interest in a existing saltwater disposal well located in the medicine hat , alberta area .
with the recent rise in oil and gas prices there has been a significant increase in production , especially in the re - initiation of wells that were previously considered uneconomical due to high water production . in the alberta oil and gas fields it is quite common to encounter ratios of 10 : 1 of water to oil production . the water produced represents a significant environmental hazard and special care , equipment , and personnel are required to deal with this byproduct of the production process .
the company has secured the services of an operator who has had 40 years experience in the oil and gas industry with 7 years experience with the specific well that smsmobility / star petroleum has acquired an interest in . as the regulatory scrutiny is quite onerous , this will insure a well - run , compliant operation that will insure a very attractive profit margin for the project .
with the ready availability of disposal water and the close proximity to a large client base , the project will be ready to commence operations in a very short timeframe . once operations commence , cash flow will be immediate with the potential for considerable growth and a long - term contribution .
this represents a very low - risk point of entry for the company which will generate an immediate contribution to revenue and cash flow . further , the location of the operations will put us within a core area of interest which we have identified for oil gas development opportunities , said mr . burns . additional details will be released in a timely manner as the project proceeds , he concluded .
