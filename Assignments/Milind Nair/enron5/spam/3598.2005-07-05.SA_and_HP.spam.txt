sports alumni , inc
( spni ) ,
it is making big moves and growing fast ! when the
nba , nfl ,
nbl , nhl ,
and mls , talk about lockouts , half seasons or
no season , salary caps , and even the referees join the turmoil
every year one of these leagues threatens the passion
for sports ! . will they play again this season ? sports alumni , inc is
about bringing the passion of the former game to all ex high
school , college , and professional athletes . not about how
big of a salary they will be making the next couple of years .
sports alumni , inc
sports alumni , inc maybe you started playing football when you where
8 years old and never quite lost the love of the game . perhaps you
even played college ball . what ever level you played , its a good bet
that your passion for the game did not end when the whistle blew and
the last play ended . that is what american football alumni seeks to
bring back to the multi - million - member target market of former and
current players and coaches .
recent surveys reveal that 70 percent of former football players would
be interested in joining a national alumni association whose makeup is
former high school and college players . seventy - nine percent are
interested in reunions with former teammates and 55 percent said
they ' d be interested in purchasing their old school football jerseys ,
especially if their names were included .
the afa will bring old teams together through its subscriber network ,
while offering on line stores of customized merchandise , a first class
magazine , conventions , football travel packages national and local
polls . this is an un - tapped industry within a multi - billion dollar
marketplace .
