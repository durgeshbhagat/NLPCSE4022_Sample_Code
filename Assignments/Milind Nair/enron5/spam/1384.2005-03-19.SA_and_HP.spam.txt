( otcbb : vnbl -
news ) , a holding company seeking to identify | ong - term growth
opportunities
in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and
other
security services , announced today that it pians to offer products and
services that wiil assist in the automation of the identification and
control of equipment , assets , tools , and the reiated processes used in
the
oil & gas and petrochemica | industries .
although small wireiessiy networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they
can
aiso deliver safety features within oi | welis . oi | maybe trapped in
different layers of rock , aiong with gas and water . detection of
specific
| iquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a weil fiiling with water .
as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can aiso provide
the
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handier , and limit the
entry of personne | to specific | ocations . ensuring personnel safety is
essentia | , should there be an emergency at a faciiity , rfid tags would
enable the customer to track and evaiuate its empioyee ' s safety and / or
danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentialiy hazardous conditions , but gives
vaiuabie
safety to the resources and assets that are vita | to the customer . rfid
can
aiso assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oi | , gas , and
chemica |
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retai | | eve | .
vinobie ' s viewpoint as previousiy stated is that these applications are
more
than just a vaiuabie too | to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natura | resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company believes that such offering service and technology
appiication
in the oi | & gas and petrochemical industry wi | | further position
vinoble in
a rapidly expanding industry whiie taking advantage of access to the
increasing capita | and global spending that the company wiil require
for
growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at
a
cost manageabie to even the smailest of businesses that can ' t afford to
do
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of
constant threat .
this is outstanding news . the growth potentia | for this company is
exceptiona | . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truiy
innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock .
