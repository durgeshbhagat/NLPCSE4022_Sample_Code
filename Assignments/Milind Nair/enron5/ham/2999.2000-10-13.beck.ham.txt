Subject: this goes to a discussion i had with jeff this morning . we have had it
problems of some sort or another every day this week which has prevented us
from getting the daily reports out by 8 : 30 ( our target time with jeff ) . i
have talked to steve stock and richard burchfield and have been trying to
reach beth for a few days to determine what can be done from an it
perspective . the problem is that it is not the same thing but has been a
different problem every day ( metacalc , servers going down , lotus notes
problems . . . ) . i will talk to beth and let you know if we need to escalate .
i would hope she would dedicate the appropriate resources to ensure that
these problems do not continue .
