i will be out of the office on wednesday , march 28 . i will be in austin
interviewing lst year mba students for the enron scholarships . this will be
the third year that enron will give two to three $ 10 , 000 scholarships to top
mba students for use in their second year in business school . it ' s great pr
for enron on campus ( largest mba scholarships given ) and it has helped in our
recruiting efforts as well . we hired one of the first scholarship winners
and he now works as an associate in generation investments in enron
americas . gene humphrey was the senior member of the four - person interview
team . now that is me . this is just a day trip , and i will check messages
during breaks and will be back in houston late wednesday afternoon .
i will also be in new york on friday , march 30 . steve kean asked that i be
the enron participant at a women in business panel discussion at columbia
school of business . i think that the list of female md ' s with their mba is
a short one .
