sensitivity in both fo and risk management control around the acurracy of p & l
and risk post the recent continental book split placed an additional ( &
necessary ) ' manual ' step within our reporting process . as we have progressed
the book split we anticipate a return to normal service
clearly we will watch closely to ensure this meets houston requirements

update - current status ( all times are london times )
officialisation for the 31 st of may dpr was made around 3 pm for both the
bilateral and the pool books .
officialisation for the 30 th was not done due to book running problems which
resulted in the dpr only being completed at 11 pm .
the last v @ r calculation was made on the 26 th due to book split problems . the
v @ r for the 31 st will be run today .
