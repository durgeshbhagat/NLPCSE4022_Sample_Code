tara ,
i talked withtodd today , but we still don ' t have anything firm yet . he
currently intends for his family to return to the u . s . sometime the week of
may 8 th with or without him . if that is the case , he himself should be able
to be out before may 15 even if he has to relocate to a hotel . however , he ' s
asked for another week to get things in order .
we agreed to talk again next tuesday , april 25 , to nail down exact dates . is
this okay ? are there any constraints that require us to firm this up before
then ?
thanks ,
tom x 33926
