rick and sally
i told the scholarship winners that within the next few weeks , we would like
to meet with them for lunch or dinner before the semester is over . so since
we are on the subject , do you have plans to be in austin any time soon ? i
will coordinate the students around your schedule . also , if you think there
are others that should join the smaller luncheon / dinner , let me know . i
thought about asking traci warner and billy lemmons since they are new to the
aa program .

are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester ? the
dinner with dean may and others from the university is great in the fall .
but last year , we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and
a few from enron . this can be simple and we don ' t have to coordinate around
the schedule of any ut faculty or staff . but it does allow enron to have a
more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their
being chosen . - - sally
