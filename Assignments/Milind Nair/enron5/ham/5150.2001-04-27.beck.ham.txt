hi tammy -
please forgive me if this message is redundant , but i wanted to make a formal request for space for the commercial support functions for enron global markets . if possible , we would like to have space reserved in the lowest tower floor available since our commercial people will be on the 3 rd floor ( as you are well aware ) .
i am estimating our needs as follows :
accounting personnel with no home on the 3 rd floor 27 ( price )
accounting personnel on 3 rd floor ( no future guarantees ) 39 ( price )
energy ops personnel on 3 rd floor ( no future guarantees ) 22 ( glover )
total potential desks needed on tower floor 88
if at all possible , i would prefer that a total of 100 desks be held to include space for future growth .
thank you for your assistance .
