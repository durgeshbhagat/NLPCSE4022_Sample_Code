i enjoyed speaking with you last week . as promised , below are proposed
times for a meeting in houston to explore the opportunity we have to
offer in more detail . i have also spoken with representatives in enron
online regarding your desire to receive a feed of deal data from eol and
should have someone available to discuss potential solutions with you .
here are some proposed dates / times to pick from . let me know what suits
your schedule best . we ' re thinking we ' ll spend the first bit of time
giving you an overview of what we ' re working on and proposing and then
go from there . we ' ll probably spend at most 2 hours in this first
meeting .
wednesday 3 / 7 anytime between 10 - 5
thursday 3 / 8 anytime between 8 - 12
