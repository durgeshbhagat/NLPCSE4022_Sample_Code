Subject: trading support operations - london
rick ,
not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support
function , particularly as it relates to our global products business , we
already have barry pearce taking a lead in this area .
the issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more
permanent solution . well - nothing is permanent in enron and i think barry
understands this as well as anybody . if we had a more suitable candidate , we
would give him / her the job .
i have seen barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the
team that we have built around him . i ' m convinced that he can add significant
value by drawing the global products support functions ' in to the fold ' .
however , he clearly has a credibility issue with ted in particular and ,
whilst i do not share ted ' s views , i do not hold barry out as a saint and i
can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded .
i suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted
within houston , who can instill confidence there . steve young ( head of rac in
london ) may be an interesting option , although i ' m sure he would not be easy
to replace . in the meantime we need barry to take things forward and i will
be monitoring the situation very closely .
regards
fernley .
