subject : names of individuals for prc representative and commercial staffing
lead
per our discussion at the executive committee meeting this morning , please
identify 2 representatives for the associate and analyst prc process and 1
individual as commercial staffing lead . the criteria for these individuals
are as follows :
prc representatives
the prc for associates and analysts will be conducted like the vp and md
process . a committee selected by executive committee members will
facilitate the process . the office of the chairman believes that
participation in the associate and analyst prc should be a platform for
exposure to election to the next level in the organization . consequently ,
associate prc representatives should be vice presidents who are on promotion
track to md and analyst representatives should be directors who are on
promotion track to vice president .
commercial staffing leads
we need your assistance to determine accurate hiring targets to ensure that
the talent we attract will be valued and utilized meaningfully . the office
of the chairman is ultimately holding each ceo accountable for working with
the program staffing coordinators to staff the talent and to determine the
hiring goals . the ceo may delegate this responsibility to a highly
respected , interested , senior commercial person . this responsibility should
not be delegated to an hr representative .
please provide the names by end of the day tomorrow , 5 / 9 / 00 . thanks , to
those of you who have responded .
