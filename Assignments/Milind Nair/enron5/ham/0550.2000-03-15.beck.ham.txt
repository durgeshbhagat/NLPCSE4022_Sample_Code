Subject: potential accommodation
hi , brent
i have a potential house for you to see if you are interested . it is very
large and is in a beautiful location right near hampstead heath . the current
occupiers are moving out most likely at the beginning of april and enron
holds the lease until the end of june . the commute is approx 35 mins to the
office .
it is in an incredible area and is very spacious with a large garden so i
would recommend seeing it . cost is ol 400 p / w plus i would need to arrange
furniture which would not be a problem .
are you interested and if so , can you see it on tuesday afternoon ? if so ,
what time would be best ?
sorry i can ' t offer it to you , sally , but we won ' t have it long enough unless
the landlord would allow us to extend which is a possiblity .
regards
tara
