Subject: power port calc issues
the power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the
power port calc . the same memory allocation issue which i discussed in the
message below is not resolved ( we have had this problem for about four months
now ) . due to business reasons , we calculated the east power books on monday
( enron holiday ) . we received all of the required data to calc by 9 : 30 am and
should have been completely done by 11 : 30 . however , the calc crashed six
times and finally completed on the seventh try . we were able to leave by
4 : 00 . the point i am trying to make is that i feel that we are at such a
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders
by the start of the next business day . this could have a financial impact on
our company . once again , i am urgently and desperately asking for resolution
of this problem .
furthermore , it came to my attention on friday that ees is now using enpower
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are .
i question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing
business that is using that server . per discussion with kevin presto , the
agreement made regarding ees ' s use of enpower was there would be no expense
or degradation to ena ' s business process . i think they need to move to
another server .
please call to discuss when this will be resolved . thank you .

subject : athena vs quark
with regards to the message below , we must have athena ( server ) to run our
nightly risk books for the power group . we run one of our three east power
calcs on this machine ( the second largest one ) . since an acceptable solution
for the big power calc has not been provided to us , athena cannot be taken
away from us . the east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week . we
usually start calcing at about 4 : 00 . the calc time is now running at 1 . 5
hours and we have about 1 . 5 hours ' worth of work after the calc ' s successful
completion . so you do the math on what time my group leaves the building
when the calc crashes at 4 : 30 .
furthermore , the west power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the
last 3 weeks . this is not acceptable .
we are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our
system is not stable . i feel like we have been very patient at the expense
of many late nights . i am going to speak to kevin presto and tim belden
today about these problems .
i think we need to meet immediately about this problem and i am exhausted
with the finger pointing between different it groups .
thanks .
