Subject: broker client procedure
attached is a draft of the broker electronic transaction agreement which will
be used to allow brokers to transact on behalf of their customers . please
review the document and give me any comments . please pay particuliar
attention to section 3 transactions .
also please note that it will be imperative that broker confirmations are
done each day on broker client transactions to limit the exposure associated
with online transaction broker breakage costs . the confirmations group will
be responsible for confirming each day and notifying credit immediately of
any discrepancies between enron and the broker . notification by the
confirmations group will be the only means by which credit will be informed
to shut down broker activity in the case of a transaction that has not been
confirmed and / or verified by the broker .
thank you
