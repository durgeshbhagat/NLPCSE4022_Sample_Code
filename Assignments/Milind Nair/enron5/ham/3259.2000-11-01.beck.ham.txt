Subject: hi and things
hi , sal . just saying hello . hope your interviews at ou went well . you
are quite the interviewing queen ! maybe you should write a book ( or
article ) sometime on " keys to snagging the right employee ! " .
good news about dad , huh ? so glad you were able to get him to see your
doctor to start the ball rolling on finding new answers for him . it is a
lot of work to find the right answers for our healthcare !
we are starting to think more about the baby ' s room . . . i think we ' re
leaning towards using your bed , if that ' s still okay . did you say that the
changing table would be available , too ? is it light wood also ?
i think we will probably get our own bed linens - but what do your look
like ? boyish ? do you think it ' s better to use a rocker or a glider ?
sorry we didn ' t make it for a fall trip . it seems that almost every
weekend one of us has been gone - chris leaves for asia on thursday for 2
weeks - it ' s a nonstop whirlwind of travel !
thanksgiving should be fun . . . what shall we bring ? is there any sort
of a plan for friday ?
i had my monthly doctor ' s appointment today : the baby is still in there and
her mom is getting very fat !
i have really enjoyed my halloween nutcracker this season ! love , cara
