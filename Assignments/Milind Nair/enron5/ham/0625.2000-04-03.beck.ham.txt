Subject: enron field
sally ,
hope all is well with you guys . i am excited about our father - daughter
outing to enron field later this month . i understand that there is a person
at enron who coordinates these events for us . if you would not mind , would
you give me the person ' s name .
eric is in the boy scouts and this sounds like an outing that would be
interesting for them also .
thanks ,
andy
