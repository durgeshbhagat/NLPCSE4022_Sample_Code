Subject: demo w / louise
hey tom and sally ,
i just wanted to give a status report of my meeting with louise kitchen
yesterday . four main issues were of confirm central were discussed : legal
loose ends and ramifications , user interface , functionality , and future
enhancements .
starting with the legal aspect louise wanted mark taylor brought into the
process . she felt his experience from eol would be useful , and would help
make any seams between eol and cl disappear . i am setting up ameeting for
early next week between mark t . , mark g . , and alan to get this process
rolling .
the user interface louise thought needed some work she definitely did not
like the colors of the website . she had good comments on how to improve the
look and feel . we will try to incorporate louise ' s suggestions as quickly as
possible . i am not to concerned about these comments since we have spent the
last 4 weeks developing functionality and have not yet focused on this issue .
louise was happy with the actual functionality of the site . she actually
said we did an excellent job .
finally , on future relases she wanted us to focus on financial & physical
power , financial & physiacl gas in the u . s . she felt that this is a market
where we could make money , where enron has enough volume that we could really
relieve some pain on our counterparties . other commodities such as liquids ,
global products , metals , she felt either did not have enough voume to justify
the business model or would take to long to integrate into cl . as far as
additional features to the site incorpoating an importing function for cp
data was high on the list , next was reporting confirmation statistics ,
exporting data , and finally automatching .
take away message from the meeting was that louise was extremely happy with
the site and our progress to date .
