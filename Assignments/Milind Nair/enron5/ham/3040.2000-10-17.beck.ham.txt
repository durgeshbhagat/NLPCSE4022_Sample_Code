dear ms . beck ,
i want to thank you for interviewing me for the analyst position last week .
i enjoyed meeting you and learning about your work . my enthusiasm for the
position and my interest in working for enron were strengthened as a result
of the interview .
i believe that my background and experience fit nicely with the job
requirements , and i am sure that i could make a significant contribution to
the firm . i have not heard back yet and would appreciate any information you
can give .
thank you ,
