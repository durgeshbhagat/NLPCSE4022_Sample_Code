mike and beth ,
i would appreciate a copy of the drift number submitted for budget 2001 and a
copy of the analysis for enron europe .
i would also like a copy of the expected new deals for 2001 reflecting the
average increase / or decrease in the pv of the gross book balance . i need
this infomation in dollar terms not percentages . i need to have the new deals
separately for gbp , nok , and eur . we are reviewing drift and our
anticipated interest rate position vs . expected 2001 economic climate .
thanks . sheila
