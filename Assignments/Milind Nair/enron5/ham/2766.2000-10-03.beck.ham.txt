Subject: risk focus group
i ' ve created a project in livelink called " risk issues focus group " , in an
attempt to centralise the communication between our groups .
to access it enter this in your browser address line
edms . livelink . enron . com / ena
when the page loads , there will a drop down box in the top - right corner with
the words " go to . . . . "
select that and then select personal workspace .
at this point its a good idea to add the browser page to your favorites as
you can then get back to your personal workspace directly
you will see a row of tabs just under the header bar and one in particular
called " projects " . if you select it a page will be displayed showing all the
projects that you are currently a member of , own , or a guest of .
in that list of projects you should see " risk issues focus group "
select that and you will be presented with the project page . . . . . there is a
search bar and a scrolling news header plus the following
an issues discussion forum
a news channel
an it and business task list
folders for documentation and process maps
this was my first stab at a layout . . . but it ' s free - format , so we can do what
we like with it
. . . . i ' ve started adding documentation already and there are some news items
and a few it tasks identified .
i would welcome comments !
regards
steve
