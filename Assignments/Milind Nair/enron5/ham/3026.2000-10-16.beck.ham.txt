Subject: doorstep meeting
sally ,
following our doorstep meeting today , i am following up on your request that
i forward to you the list of portland transactions for which we still require
documentation , e . g . invoices , sap entries , etc . for the settlements testing
only , we reduced the deal population from 23 to ten randomly - selected
transactions , in order to facilitate the settlement group ' s ability to
complete both its monthly close obligations and our doorstep request . the
deal selection is indicated in yellow , and the missing items , in green .
also per your request , attached are the five " non - standard " deals for which
we have been unable to obtain any information at all . our primary need is
just to get a basic understanding of these transactions .
