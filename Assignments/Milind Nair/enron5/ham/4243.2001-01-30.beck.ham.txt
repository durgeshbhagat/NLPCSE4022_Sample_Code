procedures and apparently this business is a disaster ! ! ! we need immediate
action on this up to and including shutting it down . this was the worst we
have seen at enron and i don ' t even want to put in this email what i heard
was going on there .
we need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster , if there
isn ' t one already . i ' ll speak with rick causey here about what immediate
action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better .
