hi mary ,
this is the end result for jim brown . he looked it over with me this
afternoon and is really pleased with the results . apparently rodney malcolm
has had over a month to provide this information and couldn ' t come through
and according to jim , this is the most and best he ' s seen ! jim will run the
numbers by harold buchanan tomorrow and let us know if that is all he needs
from us .
thanks ,
avril
