Subject: commoditylogic exposure tracker meeting
sally -
i ' d like to set up a meeting with you regarding commoditylogic ' s credit
exposure tracker .
we are displaying what we call the " exposure tracker " on our site , which will
provide two benefits : revenue enhancement by providing incentive to visit
the site every day , and control mechanism to automatically turn off early -
and pre - pay options if a counterparty exposure reaches unfavorable levels .
credit has expressed concern that our numbers will not be completely
accurate . we need your help in evaluating :
1 ) the accuracy of the numbers displayed
2 ) how to improve such accuracy if it is not sufficient , whether in credit or
in the back office
i would like to meet with you , leslie reeves , bill bradford , and my tech team
sometime early next week to validate our feature . please respond with your
availability for monday or tuesday and i will set everything up .
thanks !
