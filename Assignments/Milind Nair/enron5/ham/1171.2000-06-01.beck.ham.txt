Subject: listing of possible recruits
here is a revised summary of the 13 candidates i sent to tony vasut . i
believe he has made initial contact with each of them . if you decide you
would like to talk to them , please don ' t mention my name , as some of them are
former clients of mine , used to work with me , or still work with my husband
( i think you get the picture - i ' ve been gone from pwc less than a month ) .
however , i would be pleased to talk to you about any of the people mentioned
below .
i have categorized them into 5 categories - senior level , it / risk , mid level ,
junior level , and admin assistants . i have not spoken to the majority of
these people about giving our recruiting department their name ( see note
above ) , with the exception of mark smith , dave simpson , and connie shugart .
all of these people have indicated great interest in coming to enron .
again , please call me with any questions , or need of further info . my
extension is 39123 .
best regards
shona
senior level risk people
andy dunn
until 3 weeks ago he was a director in the pwc risk management practice . due
to a falling out between andy and the partners ( not client related ) , he left
the firm . he is extremely well respected by both the audit and the non - audit
personnel , and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise . i have worked
with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend him to enron .
the downside to andy is that he lives in denver , is used to travelling a lot ,
but , at the last time we spoke ( a few months ago ) , is not interested in
leaving denver . his cell phone ( if still in use ) is 303 807 0040 .

many different roles ( he worked as a crude trader , products trader , he worked
in the risk management department , in the refinery itself as an engineer ) .

knowledge and background . i would highly recommend him for a leadership role
at enron . i spoke to him and he is interested in pursuing opportunities at

to say she was one of the best people i have worked with in the capacity of a
client / professional relationship . marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at
the alliance and is extremely well respected . she has had a difficult year
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3 + people . she has mentioned to
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase ,
and has even mentioned finding another job . however , due to the fact that
she is so well respected where she is , she may be difficult to recruit ( 713
277 6280 ) . if you contact her i would not want my name associated with it
due to the pwc / alliance relationship .

he is currently a senior accountant at pwc . he is the best senior pwc
houston has , as well as probably one of the best people i have ever worked
with ( the top of his class ) . although he only has 4 years of work experience
( all at pwc ) , he performs in a manager capacity . he worked for me on the
coral energy audit engagement and received an excellent evaluation from both
myself and the partners ( we all agreed that he is one of the best people any
of us have seen or worked with ) . he is currently working on a project at one
of pwc ' s clients to standardize their mid office processes . he definitely
does not see himself as a long time employee of pwc , but is currently
