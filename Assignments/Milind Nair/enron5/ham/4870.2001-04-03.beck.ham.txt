mary ,
are you around - your voicemail message has said you were out for the day , for weeks .
we have a need for a crm system , but not a very complicated one , and i thought that the one that tony mends demonstrated a couple of years ago might fit the bill . he tells me that it is in your area of responsibilities !
thanks ,
richard
