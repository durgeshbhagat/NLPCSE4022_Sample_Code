i spoke with tom about finding the correct training for you . he also feels
that attending all of the classes you are currently signed up for in ernie is
not the right approach . he wants to meet with you to discuss this .
currently , we believe the best approach to be :
attending successful working relationships - he will ensure you get into this
class
attending communicating effectively for leaders - you are already signed up
do 1 on 1 coaching - he is currently looking for someone who would fit
attending a 360 class - these are few and far between . he is looking for one .
tom and hector are trying to figure what classes present soft skills in a
format that you will be familiar with - essentially a class that puts a
quantitative spin on soft skills ( these are obviously a bit harder to find ) .
thanks
shona
