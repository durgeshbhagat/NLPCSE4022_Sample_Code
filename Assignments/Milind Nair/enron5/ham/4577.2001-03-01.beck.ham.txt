a toast to texas !
as early as 1900 , march 2 became a day for texas exes to observe as a
holiday . a
great deal of tradition and sentiment surrounds the celebration
on the local level . in that year , the ex - students ' association adopted a
resolution that :
" whenever two texas exes shall meet on march 2 , they shall sit and break
bread and
pay tribute to the institution that made their education possible . " ut alumni
all over the
world have followed this tradition . wherever you are on march 2 , 2001 , we
hope you ' ll
join us in a texas " toast " : to our state , whose founders made our education
possible ;
to texas exes who have provided generations of leadership ; and to the proud
tradition
of continued excellence of the university of texas . hook ' em horns ! for more
