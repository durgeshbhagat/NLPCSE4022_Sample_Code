Subject: panama city doorstep
dear lynn ,
as it turns out , there is no deal documentation for the panama city deals in
panama ( everything is in houston ) . therefore , the deal test will need to be
done from houston and we won ' t need anyone from your group to attend the
upcoming doorstep . scott and michelle bruce will obtain the population when
then are in panama and also write the report .
best regards
shona
