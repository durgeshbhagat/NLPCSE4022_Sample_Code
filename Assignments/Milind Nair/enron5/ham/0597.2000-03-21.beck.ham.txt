Subject: global entelligence status
just want to give you a couple of updates .
the prototype of the market penetration window was shown to jennifer fraser
and chris gaskill yesterday . the overall response was very positive . based
on this , it will provide a firmer estimate for delivery of phase i by the end
of the week .
the cost for the d & b data has been reduced by $ 100 k after additional
negotiations . pursuant to that , the agreement was signed last week . the
requested data was received yesterday .

just wanted to let you know a few updates :
1 ) we have a full it team now ready to go . we are going to prototype the
first window , market penetration . the prototype will give us something with
sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on
functionality . hopefully , we will have something in 2 weeks .
2 ) the previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from
the prototype . the estimates are $ 1 . 6 m for phase i and $ 1 . 6 m for remaining
phases .
3 ) included in the cost estimate is a figure of $ 389 k for the purchase of
customer prospect data from dun & bradstreet . the $ 389 k is an o & m expense
amount that was not included in the 2000 budget . this amount combined with
other amounts ena did budget for or will spend with d & b results in an overall
budget impact over the next 12 months of $ 278 k .
i spoke with george wasaff in strategic sourcing this morning at the request
of philippe bibi . george has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from
d & b . either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate
better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with d & b . this
could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready
to go for implementation . i believe i can give george some time to try
something , but when it comes down to it , $ 389 k isn ' t that much money .
therefore , i suggest that if we don ' t have anything negotiated in the next
three weeks , we sign the current proposal from d & b and move forward . d & b
is currently threatening ( a negotiation tactic , i think ) to pull their
development resources off of this project until they receive a signed
agreement . in the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our
delivery of global entelligence , we can provide a letter of intent to keep
them moving or sign the proposal at that time .
give me a call at 3 - 6079 if you have any comments on any of the above items .
