sally ,
thanks for the voice - mail . while we have selected a date , it is not cast in
stone . if there is another date that works better and would allow more of
the individuals to participate , that is fine with me . i just want to make
sure that the program is being responsive . incidentally , i did not realize
that rick would be out of town , so it is no problem to change the date .
you indicated that you would be willing to provide a few bullet points
regarding the issues you and the group would like for us to address . that
would be great . please forward those at your earliest convenience .
i will assume that you will notify the other individuals of the date and time
of the meeting , wednesday , april 19 th at 10 : 00 a . m . if this assumption is
not correct please provide the names of the other individuals who will attend
the meeting and i will call them . also if you decide it makes sense to
change the date , just let me know .
thanks for your assistance .
