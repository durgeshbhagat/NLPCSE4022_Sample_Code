no memo out yet on the doorstep process . i am still in the throws of
completing the 13 reviews that i have to give - should be finished by 5 : 00 .
i will send the memo on doorstep process to you , fernley and michael brown
before i leave for the day .
i will be in the calgary office wednesday and thursday with peggy hedstrom
and her team . back in the houston office on friday .
hope that james ' visit is going well . thanks for getting appointments
organized for him .
i look forward to seeing you in dallas next week . i am glad that you ,
richard and steve will be able to participate . are you still planning to
come back to houston after the meeting in dallas ? i fly from dallas to
austin on tuesday night , so that i can do a full day of interviews at ut for
summer interns on wednesday . i will be back in the office on thursday and
friday that week . let me know if we can help in setting up any
appointments . we can do lunch on thursday or friday , if your schedule
allows . i can also set some time aside to perhaps download from our dallas
meeting and to follow up on some other issues . i would offer dinner on
thursday night , but that is my birthday and i think ( hope ) that my family
will have dinner plans for me that evening . is there someone else in houston
that you would like to have dinner with while you are here ? - - sally
