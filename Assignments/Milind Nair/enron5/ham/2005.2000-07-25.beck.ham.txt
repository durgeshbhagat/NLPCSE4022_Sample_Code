Subject: clickpaper now transactable
clickpaper is now on the web with transactable prices .
at 8 : 30 am tuesday the 25 th , we did our first trade , a 42 # linerboard trade
( the outside part of a cardboard box ) with con agra ( 13 , 500 tons and about
$ 6 , 000 , 000 notional ) . we hope to do another trade today with irving as well .
i am sure we will have a new list of bugs at the end of today but i think we
are past the major issues .
going forward ( next two to three weeks ) , we will be working to get the
product offering from its current 21 financial to about 50 financial as well
as adding in physical at rotterdam . we will also be ready to handle any
newsprint from garden state at the end of august . we also have some text
changes and minor programming related to wording on the site that is new or
unclear to the industry .
we will continue to push for registration ( currently at 12 who now have user
id , password and made it through credit , legal , tax ) .
the markets load in about 4 seconds now so we fixed the slowness issue .
we will also start generating a report each day on stats that are relevant .
i will try to get some read only ids for people but give me a little time to
get this done . i want my tech people sitting with the traders this week
showing them the system and making sure everything is working . they also need
to go back through what they did the last month and make sure they clean up
some steps .
we will work on a press release to maybe go out mid to late august to
coincide with a larger customer mailing , a few adds in industry publications ,
physical product and a complete suite of financial products .
i would like to thank everyone who helped us get to this launched
successfully . however , we all realize this is a beginning , not an ending ,
and that there is a significant amount of work still ahead .
thanks .
