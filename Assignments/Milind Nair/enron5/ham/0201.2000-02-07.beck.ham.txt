dear ms . beck ,
i am writing to you to express my interest in working for enron . i have
long been interested in a career in business , and i would love the
opportunity to explore business in enron this summer .
as i have worked with the harvard entrepreneurs club ( hec ) and various
entrepreneurs association around the country to spearhead the effort to
form a national collegiate entrepreneurs organization , i have learned a
great deal about how organizations work and how to make them effective .
this theme of entrepreneurship has spilled over into my other activities as
well . i am coordinating the first annual fundraising banquet for christian
impact to help us raise money for outreach events . i am also co - leading
the first mission trip comprised of harvard students this summer . because
this effort is taking me to latin america for the first half of the summer ,
i will be in houston from mid - july to mid - september . if there is a
position available at enron , i would enjoy working for it while i am here .
i am excited about the opportunity to learn more about the business world .
the combination of resourcefulness , rigorous logic , and creativity called
for in the business sphere intrigues me . the integration of global and
analytical thinking also piques my interest . i have attached my resume for
you to review , i will be in houston from march 27 - 31 if you would like to
interview me . thank you for your consideration . i look forward to hearing
from you !
