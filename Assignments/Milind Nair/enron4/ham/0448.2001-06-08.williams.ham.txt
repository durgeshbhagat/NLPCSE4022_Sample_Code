Subject: willamet / pac deal on 2 - 15 - 01
dear bill , kate , and les ,
i wanted to let you all know what we are doing concerning deals # 524528 . 1 ( purchase from willamet ) and 524529 . 1 ( sale to pace ) .
i believe that we are all now familiar with the details of these deals . mike , geir , les , and i have spent a combined 4 hours or more researching this deal over the last month . our last resort is to pull the tapes . as we do not have access to our tapes and i am not sure when we will have them back , we have decided to do the following until we have the tapes back and can verify that the sale to pac did take place :
* i have extended the sale of 4 mw ' s of willamet generation to pac to include he 13 .
* i have temporarily zero ' d out the he 14 - 24 piece of this deal on the pac side with notes
as the payment is 3 months overdue , we will pay now and get reimbursed if we find that we are correct .
please share any thoughts with me that you may have .
thanks to everyone for your help in researching this .
