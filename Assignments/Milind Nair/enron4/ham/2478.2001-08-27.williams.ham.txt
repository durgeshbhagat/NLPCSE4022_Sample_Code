Subject: intra - zonal congestion
the iso is experiencing increasing loading on the pittsburg - tassaraja 230 kv
line and requires additional decremental energy bids on the north side of
the path and incremental energy bids on the south side of the path . to the
extent that scheduling coordinators do not respond with sufficient energy
bids to mitigate the anticipated congestion , the iso may invoke the other
steps of the intra - zonal congestion management procedure . sent by market
operations .
the system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change . while the iso has attempted to reflect the most current ,
accurate information available in preparing this notice , system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice .
