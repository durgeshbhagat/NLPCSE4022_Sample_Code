kate ,
we are missing an id - s from st - wbom to st - cali for saturday . we sold 50 mws to st - cali at $ 42 . 89 . this should be the same as friday ' s deal # 683947 . we either need a new deal for saturday or need to make friday ' s on - peak deal carry over into saturday .
if you are changing the friday deal you need to do it before the flash , otherwise if you make a new deal for saturday you should have some time .
thanks for the help .
bill
