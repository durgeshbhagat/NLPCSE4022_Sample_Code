you have been selected to interview real time candidate justin bates . justin will be returning to the office for his second round of interviews and has indicated that early morning interviews will work best for his schedule .
with that in mind , i would like to set up the interviews to take place at 8 : 00 am on thursday , july 12 th . each session will be about 45 minutes in length ( max ) , with the last interview ending at 11 : 00 am .
if you are aware of any conflicts with this day / time , please let me know as soon as possible . i would like to have the schedule finalized by tomorrow morning .
if you have any questions , let me know !
thanks ,
grace
