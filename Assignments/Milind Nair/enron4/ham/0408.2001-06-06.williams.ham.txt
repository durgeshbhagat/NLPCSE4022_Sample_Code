heather i have gone through the pma ' s and portions of them look appropriate , however , i would appreciate it if you could look into a couple of deals for me .
first :
st - whourly
02 / 24 / 01 - - deal # 530686 and 530687 . when mark guzman originally made these deals he neglected to put in a 35 mw purchase from wwp at $ 200 for he 1 - 6 . he also neglected to put in the 35 mw sale to wesco at $ 275 . the pma shows the cost for the 35 mw purchase from wwp at $ 200 , but does not show the revenue from the 35 mw sale to wesco at $ 275 . these changes were put in at the same time on the same day per virginia . this is approximately $ 57 , 750 .
03 / 22 / 01 - - deal # 558190 . david porter originally put this deal in as a buy from st - cali . the deal should have been a buy from ees . i changed the counterparty only , approximately 2 hours after the flash . the charge of $ 18750 is the entire charge for the deal ( 25 mws at $ 125 for he 1 - 6 ) . if i am charged by ees , i believe i should receive revenue from st - cali for the expense that went out with the flash .
st - wbom
04 / 24 / 01 - - deal # 590753 . geir solberg entered a buy - resale for $ 320 and $ 30 . . . i corrected this to 320 and 300 for a difference of $ 20 on 04 / 27 / 01 . this represents a $ 108 , 000 change for the better .
there may be more , but this is all i have for now .
again , i appreciate you taking the time to look into these .
thanks ,
bill
