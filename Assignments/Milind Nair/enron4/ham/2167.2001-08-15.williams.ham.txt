Subject: new enpower issue
i have one more thing to add to the list of enpower requests :
deals done under the epmi short term west hourly desk do not need to be confirmed . the real time traders know they need to check " no " in the confirmation box in deal entry ; however , it ' s one detail amidst many that sometimes gets overlooked . it occurred to me that we could avoid the problem of real time deals getting unnecessarily confirmed - and unnecessarily confusing counterparties - if we could make " no confirmation " an automatic default for all deals entered under the short term west hourly book .
i can ' t think of any other groups which would be adversely impacted by this change , but let ' s discuss that during the next enpower meeting . please let me know what we can do to get this implemented .
thanks for your help ,
kate
