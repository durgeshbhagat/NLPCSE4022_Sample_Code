subject : copper
after careful consideration and discussions with the dispatchers , i
decided to leave copper on for friday night 8 / 18 . there were several
reasons for this decision including the pv outage , the fact that ,
newman 1 was only released for 32 megawatts , and the fact that when we
needed copper last night during the pv outage they had problems bringing
it up . i felt that from a reliability standpoint it was probably the
right thing to due given those factors . if either of you have any
questions or concerns regarding this matter please feel free to contact
me . thanks - - guz
