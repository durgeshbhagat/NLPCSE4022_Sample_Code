state of utter confusion , frustration and hopelessness by the present
civilian administration , i have been subjected to physical and
psychological torture by the security agents in the country .
i have lost confidence with anybody within the country . you must have
heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of
various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different
security firms abroad , some companies willingly give up their secrets
and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many out right

i shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account
for safe keeping . this arrangement is known to you my lawyer and my son
