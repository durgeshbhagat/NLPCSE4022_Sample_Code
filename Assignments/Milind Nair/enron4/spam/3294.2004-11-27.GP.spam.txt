hello , playmates ! : ) tunaalabagana
leadership involves finding a parade and getting in front of it . ambition is a lust that is never quenched , but grows more inflamed and madder by enjoyment . we judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing , while others judge us by what we have already done . whatever deceives men seems to produce a magical enchantment . pandemonium did not reign it poured . there is no love sincerer than the love of food .
he that is conscious of guilt cannot bear the innocence of others : so they will try to reduce all others to their own level . competition is a process or variety of habitual behavior that grows out of a habit of mind . it has yet to be proven that intelligence has any survival value .
he is mad past recovery , but yet he has lucid intervals .
there are more love songs than anything else . if songs could make you do something we ' d all love one another .
nothing dies harder than a bad idea .
failure too is a form of death . . . writing about music is like dancing about architecture it ' s a really stupid thing to want to do . love is only chatter , friends are all that matter .
be not curious in unnecessary matters : for more things are shrewd unto thee than men understand .
one of the striking differences between a cat and a lie is that the cat has only nine lives . man is emphatically a proselytizing creature .
