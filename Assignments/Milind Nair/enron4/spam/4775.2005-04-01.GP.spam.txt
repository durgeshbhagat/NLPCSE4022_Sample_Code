vancouver , british coiumbia , march 30 , 2 oo 5 ( primezone ) - - montana oil
and gas , inc . , ( pink sheets : mogi ) president peter sanders is please to
announce the following update on its sylvan lake project .
after severa | delays due to unseasonabie weather and road ciosures in
the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig was moved onto
| ocation
over the weekend and ensign dri | | ing has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m we | |
a
nd are currentiy driiling at 1 , 25 o feet . surface casing wil | be run to
930 feet . the drilling rig is known as a telescopic double and is rated
to dri | | to lo , 00 o feet in depth . drilling operations are expected to
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the county may impose a
restriction
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring
breakup
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage . this is an annual
event ,
which occurs in most of central and northern canada when the frost ,
which
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground . drilling operations
for
a | arge rig such as the sylvan lake wel | requires service by heavy
vehicies
such as mud , water , cement and vacuum trucks which wiil be prohibited
from
using the roads during this period of time . peter sanders notes ,
§ the road bans that have been taking piace ail over alberta happen
every year
and in the spring is no surprise , a | | oi | and gas companies are
effected by
breakup , the good thing is , is that we have the rig on site , which wi | |
remain there until we are finished dri | | ing , surface casing has been
compieted and we wiil be ready to finish driliing the minute the road
bans are | ifted .
the syivan lake prospect is a we | | defined 3 - d seismic structural high
within a preserved pekisko remnant isiand that may have virgin
reservoirs
with simiiar production potentia | as the adjacent n poo | where 6 wells
have
produced 680 , oo 0 barrels oi | since 1997 . in overall , the syivan fieid
has
produced 4 o mi | | ion barreis of oi | from the pekisko formation and 50
bi | | ion
cubic feet of gas from the shunda formation .
ensign dri | | ing wil | test a tota | of 3 o feet from severa | zones in the
shunda
formation at 7 , 155 feet and a 30 - foot pekisko oi | formation at 7 , 320
feet .
when driiling resumes , the hoie is pianned to reach a tota | depth of
7 , 570 feet ,
which may take some lo days to then complete drilling and testing .
each deveiopment weil has probabie production of 150 barrels of oil per
day
and 750 ? thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1
biilion
cubic feet gas and 30 o , ooo barreis of oi | . there are four other pay
zones that
are prospective for gas . the average we | | in the sylvan lake field has
produced
500 barreis of oi | per day and / or over one miliion cubic feet of gas
per day .
if successful , the company intends to dril | up to 4 more welis on these
land
sections . this immediate area has been developed for both oi | and
natural gas
over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas
gathering and
processing faciiities and oil transportation faciiities have been
constructed .
