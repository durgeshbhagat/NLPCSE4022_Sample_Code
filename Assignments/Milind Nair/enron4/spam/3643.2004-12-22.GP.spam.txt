the display of grief makes more demands than grief itself . how few men are sad in their own company .
a person dishonored is worst than dead . the pencil of the holy ghost hath labored more in describing the afflictions of job than the felicities of solomon .
skillful listening is the best remedy for loneliness , loquaciousness , and laryngitis . the bastard ! he doesn ' t exist !
always remember , a cat looks down on man , a dog looks up to man , but a pig will look man right in the eye and see his equal . the wise does at once what the fool does at last .
