resources ltd . ( knp - tsx venture )
knight resources share trading
exploded to the upside today as it and jv partner anglo american announced that
drilling has begun on their west raglan project . this marks the start of the
2005 c $ 5 million exploration program , and while only one rig will be in operation

today was 5 . 2 million shares and the price increased 80 % , we suspect that there
is more going on than a simple reaction to an expected announcement . with that
in mind , a quick review of the project is in order .
