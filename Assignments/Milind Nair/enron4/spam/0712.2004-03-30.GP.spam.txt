the business
tmxt is poised to embark on a period of seemingly unbridled growth as it furthers its expansion as a leader in electronic ignition and ignition - based products for the automotive , boating and trucking markets . tmxt is continuously working with companies and individuals in the automotive , boating and trucking industries to create and develop strategic and marketing alliances .
through these types of joint ventures and alliances tmxt believes it will be able to make immediate and significant inroads into these industries resulting in significant immediate and long - term revenue streams for tmxt .
while some may say that providing new solutions for ignitions may seem less than exciting , tmxt is well aware that these markets offer tmxt a significant opportunity to sell products and services into multi - billion dollar industries that are struggling to find solutions .
tmxt ' s products appear to be welcome solutions for the age - old question , " how can we get better gas mileage , dependability and torque from the internal combustion engine " . these industries repeat these same questions , but tmxt might very well have the answers .
with tmxt ' s shares currently trading in the $ 0 . 40 range , it seems apparent the financial community has yet to factor in the enormous growth and profit potential of tmxt ' s innovative product introduction and attractive revenue model .
in addition , the street has left the shares to be unrecognized and undiscovered , as well as undervalued , based on its transition into a powerful growth vehicle .
additionally , tmxt intends to make application to a more principal u . s . stock exchange to further attract both retail , as well as institutional interest . with an effective and diversified cutting - edge product line , virtual worldwide penetration potential , solid margins , strong industry backdrop , aggressive marketing plan , modified revenue model , outstanding comprehensive customer service , state - of - the - art technology , significant competitive advantages and an experienced hands - on management team .
tmxt represents a compelling risk / reward situation in the lucrative auction site arena . our 12 - month target for the shares of tmxt technologies , inc . is $ 1 . 50 $ 2 . 00 , with the potential for strong upside surprises .
